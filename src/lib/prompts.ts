export const JUDGE_GUIDE = `Guide to Creating High-Engagement Reddit Posts in SaaS/MicroSaaS Subreddits
Overall Themes of High Engagement Posts:

The most successful posts revolve around:


Personal Stories & Journeys: Founders sharing real experiences, struggles, and successes (both big and small, including failures).

Controversial/Debate-Sparking Opinions: Challenging common wisdom or popular narratives.

Value-Driven Offers/Giveaways: Providing tangible help or resources (e.g., free access, reviews, custom work).

Calls for Community Interaction: Asking direct questions, requesting insights, or inviting participation.

Transparent Metrics & Learnings: Sharing actual numbers, what worked, and what didn't.

1. Crafting Compelling Titles
Your title is the first and often only thing people see. Make it count.

Key Strategies:


Be Personal & Relatable: Use "I," "My," "We." People connect with individual stories.
Examples: "I raised $130M for my last startup, then walked away...", "I just VIBECODED an entire SAAS...", "I spent 6 months building an app that made exactly $0 in revenue ðŸ’¸", "It took 7 months to get my first paying customer. Then it took 8 months to reach $33k revenue. Keep going!"

Highlight a Clear Outcome/Achievement (Positive or Negative):
Positive: "$3.5M ARR, 300K+ users, no employees, fully bootstrapped. Then acquired by Wix for $80M. AMA.", "My product has made $76.16 and I'm over the moon with excitement.", "My SaaS project made $4.6k+ in less than 110 days with an idea that everyone told me wouldn't work."
Negative/Lessons Learned: "I spent 6 months building an app that made exactly $0 in revenue ðŸ’¸", "I left my Job, Spent almost 10 Months, $20K of loss Building an AI Design/Infographics Tool That Made $0 and Got 0 Users."

Pose a Strong, Open-Ended Question: Invite immediate debate or contribution.
Examples: "I still don't understand what is wrong with spreadsheets", "Is AI vibe coding killing SaaS?", "Why is every post here AI generated?", "What's the biggest pain point in finding business on Reddit that no tool solves yet?"

Introduce a Controversial or Unpopular Opinion: This is a surefire way to drive comments.
Examples: "Donâ€™t build in public â€” itâ€™s killing your startup (and no one wants to admit it)", "Don't build a SaaS if you just want easy money", "Your SaaS isn't dying because of churn. It's dying because you're selling to broke people."

Offer Value Directly: Make it clear what the reader will gain.
Examples: "I will build custom AI Agents for your business for FREE (5 spots only)", "Talked to 40 SaaS founders who grew from $5k â†’ $100k MRR. These 7 patterns kept showing up.", "Drop your SaaS and I'll reply with free custom promo video!"

Pique Curiosity: Use numbers, bold claims, or intriguing setups.
Examples: "My SaaS made $60,000 before we built the product. Here's how we validated demand by faking automation:", "$200K/Month from a Todo App?!"

Leverage Sarcasm/Humor (with caution):
Example: "Built an AI last night that teaches monkeys to write. Hit $7M ARR this morning . I am 11 years old ." (This clearly satirizes common "indie hacker success" posts).

Call for Engagement in the Title: Clearly ask for input.
Examples: "Show us your successful SaaS", "What are you building? Describe it in only 6 words.", "Link your SaaS we'll find you 5 customers for free", "Share your SaaS, Iâ€™ll be your paid customer or user"

What to Avoid in Titles (based on low-engagement posts):


Generic requests for help or validation without unique context.
Examples: "I need market validation and I need it fastâ€¦", "Looking for validation", "How to start saas"

Overly technical or niche questions that don't immediately resonate with a broad audience.
Examples: "Memory in SaaS", "Saas architecture with a single tenant application"

Straightforward self-promotion without a clear value proposition for the reader.
Examples: "Just launch my first ai edutech on product hunt ðŸ”¥" (Unless it's tied to a major achievement as above).

Titles that sound like job postings (unless explicitly a "looking for cofounder" type post that sets expectations for specific skills).
Examples: "you need a developer in automation/App for your SaaS?"

2. Crafting Engaging Body Content
Once you have their attention with the title, the body content needs to deliver.

Key Strategies:


Tell a Story (Narrative Arc):
Hook: Start with the problem, the unexpected result, or a bold claim.
Example: "I was seriously thinking of shutting down my product yesterday. After a week of marketing and receiving mixed feedback, I started to feel like it just wasnâ€™t going to work out." ("It finally happened â€” got my first paying user today!")
Struggle/Context: Detail the challenges, efforts, or conventional wisdom that didn't work. This builds empathy and credibility.
Example: "I poured 10 months into coding what I thought was an innovation... I Launched it. Dreamed of users flooding in. Result? Zero dollars. Zero users." ("I left my Job, Spent almost 10 Months...")
Discovery/Solution/Turning Point: Explain what changed, what you learned, or the insight gained.
Example: "But this morning, I woke up to a notification â€” someone purchased the premium version!" ("It finally happened â€” got my first paying user today!") or "The fix was simple. Instead of selling to individual restaurants, we started selling to restaurant groups." ("How to increase a SaaS from $12K to $50K MRR...")
Results/Proof: Provide evidence (numbers, screenshots, anecdotes). Be transparent.
Example: "$3.5M ARR, 300K+ users, no employees, fully bootstrapped.", "My product has made $76.16 (after Stripe fees)...", "It hit $18k in revenue with over 100 paying users."
Lessons Learned/Actionable Advice: Summarize your takeaways for the benefit of the reader.
Example: "Hereâ€™s what I wish Iâ€™d known before wasting 6 months of my life. The mistakes that cost me thousands: No validation... Feature creep..." ("I spent 6 months building an app...")

Be Vulnerable and Authentic: Share failures, doubts, and personal struggles. This builds strong connection.
Examples: "I used to dread cold outreach â€“ It felt like shouting into the void.", "I don't know if itâ€™s just me, but being a solo founder is way lonelier than I expected."

Provide Concrete Examples & Data: Don't just talk in generalities. Show actual numbers, tools used, specific changes made.
Examples: "$74,223 revenue", "DR 25 to DR 35", "95%+ NRR solid", "3x/week" for LinkedIn posts.

Structure with Headings and Bullet Points: Make longer posts easy to read and digest.

End with a Clear Call to Action (CTA):
Ask for opinions/experiences: "What do you guys think?", "What worked for you?"
Invite further discussion: "Happy to answer any questions."
Encourage sharing their own work (if applicable): "Drop your current projects with below format:", "Link your SaaS we'll find you X customers for free."
Offer specific help/resource: "Drop a comment or DM me if youâ€™re interested."

Leverage "Before & After" or "What Worked/Didn't Work" Formats: This is highly educational and engaging.
Examples: "My lessons from building 8 saas products (4 failed):", "Here's what I wish I'd known before wasting 6 months of my life. The mistakes that cost me thousands: ... What actually works (from my second app):", "What worked and what didn't" posts.

Address Common Pain Points or Misconceptions: Show you understand the community's struggles.
Example: "I still don't understand why do people use websites, apps, tools all in the name of productivity when all they need is a well designed spreadsheet."

What to Avoid in Body Content (based on low-engagement posts):


Generic marketing copy: If it sounds like a press release or a bland product description, it won't resonate.

Lack of personal investment: If the post doesn't feel like it comes from a real person's experience, it gets ignored.

Unsubstantiated claims: If you claim success, provide proof or at least a detailed explanation of "how."

Overly salesy pitches: While offering value (e.g., free access, reviews) is encouraged, direct, aggressive sales pitches usually perform poorly unless there's an extraordinary offer.

Not engaging with comments: High-engagement posts often have the OP actively replying and discussing.

3. Timing and Community Engagement

Post on Weekdays: Most high-engagement posts in this dataset were posted on weekdays, especially Monday-Wednesday. Fridays are decent, but weekends tend to be slower.

Engage with Comments: The most commented posts often involve the original poster actively replying to questions and continuing the discussion. This signals authenticity and fosters a strong community feeling.

Be a Regular Contributor (Not Just a Promoter): While not explicitly visible in the data, the highly successful users (like "IntroductionHumble16" or "No_Librarian9791") often have a history of contributing valuable content to the subreddit beyond just promoting their own product. This builds trust and makes their posts more likely to be well-received.

Visuals (if appropriate): While most posts are text-only, a relevant image or a GIF/video (especially for product demos or proof of revenue/users) can significantly boost engagement (e.g., "$33k revenue image + video since it's Reddit ðŸ˜…", "I just VIBECODED an entire SAAS: CHECK IT OUT on localhost:3000" with implied video).`;
