This is kind of a rant  I still don't understand why do people use websites, apps, tools all in the name of productivity when all they need is a well designed spreadsheet.  Google sheets literally has everything. Programmable, Access Control, Collaboration  You want more but don't know how to code? Vibe code your way around a spreadsheet.  I meet people who call themselves \"vibe coders\", and are proud of the fact they don't know coding. Nothing wrong with that. Often times what they build is so basic it could all have been one spreadsheet.  You build one tool for yourself, another and another. Soon you will be building tools to manage your tools. Tech is supposed to simplify our lives not complicate them."}

I didn't expect much difference, but I hoped it would help.  So I did these things  Sent an email to existing people on the waitlist  Posted on twitter, bluesky, peerlist, etc.  Posted on reddit  And the rest is history (maybe small for other but big for me)  On the first day after launching, I got 2 sales, and just a few days later, I received my 3rd sale.  One of the users even reached out to me, complimenting me on what I had built and how it was a great idea, which meant the world to me. It meant that what I built is leaving an impact on others.  I am happy beyond words :)  I am even happer as people are loving the product that I made. I have received so much good feedback, and it makes me even happier that people are actually engaging with the product and upgrading to the paid plan.  I hope this brings smiles to all reading this post :) and inspires a few of you.  PS - Here is a link to my product:¬†Tavora .net¬†.

Some bootstrapped. Some lightly funded. All trying to grow without burning out.  I wasn‚Äôt trying to find some ‚Äúsecret formula,‚Äù but after 30‚Äì40 convos, a few clear patterns started to repeat.  Here are 7 that stuck with me:  1. One ‚Äúhero metric‚Äù at a timeInstead of tracking 20 things, they zoomed in on one metric (often activation %) and focused on nothing else for 6‚Äì12 weeks.  2. Retention before growthNone of them scaled paid ads until retention was solid. Like, 95%+ NRR solid. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just fueling churn.  3. Ruthless onboarding simplificationThe goal? Get users to their first win in under 3 minutes. Most of the time, that meant deleting steps, not adding tooltips.  4. Founder-led demos still matterEven at $80k+ MRR, a bunch of them were still hopping on 5+ demo calls/week. Apparently, ‚Äútalk to the builder‚Äù beats any sales funnel.  5. Annual billing after product-market fitThey didn‚Äôt start with it, but once churn was under control, annual plans helped fund that next hire or experiment.  6. Start niche, then expandThe ones who grew fastest weren‚Äôt trying to serve ‚Äúevery startup.‚Äù They nailed a narrow use case (like ‚ÄúXero accountants in Canada‚Äù) first.  7. Obsess over every cancellationThis one hit hard ‚Äî most of them personally followed up on every cancel with 1‚Äì2 simple questions. Feedback was shipped fast.  I‚Äôm curious now,  if you‚Äôve grown a SaaS past $5k MRR, what did your turning points look like?  What made a real difference?  And if you're earlier than that which of these do you agree or totally disagree with?  Would love to hear what‚Äôs resonated (or flopped) in your journey."}

Everyone on Twitter is telling you to share your story, post your numbers, document everything.They say the crowd will show up. Revenue will follow.  All nonsense.  Here's what actually happens:    You chase dopamine, not dollars You get likes, comments, maybe a blue check retweet. Now you're hooked on fake validation. You start working for claps, not customers.    You forget what actually matters Instead of writing code or closing a deal, you're busy crafting a post about your tech stack. It feels productive. It's not.    You enter the founder echo chamber Other indie hackers cheering you on doesn't mean you're solving a real problem. They aren't your customers. They can't pay you.    You give away your playbook Your CAC, your roadmap, your feature plans. Every post helps your competitors copy or counter you faster.    You confuse engagement with traction Likes aren't revenue. Followers aren't customers. Retweets aren't product-market fit.    You waste a ridiculous amount of time Writing posts, designing visuals, replying to comments... it adds up to hours every week. That time could be used for fixing bugs or talking to actual users.    You attract the \"advice avalanche\" Suddenly everyone is an expert. Hot takes, growth hacks, recycled advice. 99% of it is noise from people who haven't built anything in years.    You turn Stripe into content Posting \"$1k MRR\" screenshots is just the startup version of gym selfies. Your customers don‚Äôt care. Ship value, not screenshots.    You create invisible pressure You feel like you always need to post. Always need to show progress. This leads to rushed features, fake momentum, and eventual burnout.    You get market-blind Your tweets get likes, so you assume the product is working. It‚Äôs not. Likes don't mean you‚Äôre solving a real problem.    Here's what you should do instead:    Build in private. Sell in public.    Share results, not the process. Nobody cares how the sausage gets made.    Hang out where your customers are. Not where other founders like to lurk.    Build for your users.Not Twitter.Not Indie Hackers.Not Reddit.Not your ego.  The best founders I know aren't building in public.They're building in focus.

This post is structured like a funnel. First, I‚Äôll break down where I get leads from. Then how I convert them, how I book demos, close deals, and finally how I actually sell.  Let‚Äôs start with lead sources.  I use three types of traffic to generate leads:    Outbound leads: I use my own product, gojiberry ai, to detect high-intent leads. These are people who‚Äôve liked or commented on competitors‚Äô content, recently raised funds, hired new staff, or showed other buying signals on social. Goji lets me do social listening and generates enriched leads automatically every day.    Inbound leads: These come from organic content. I post regularly on Reddit and other platforms. People reach out to me directly. Zero ad spend required for this channel.    Paid traffic: I also invest in paid ads and influencer shoutouts when it makes sense. This includes YouTube creators, Instagram, and niche newsletters.    So those are my three buckets: outbound (high-intent scrapes), inbound (organic), and paid (ads/influencers).  Let‚Äôs talk about tools now.  For outbound cold email, I use Instantly. I send around 1000 emails per day and I need to feed the machine with 500 to 700 new leads daily. Goji takes care of that part, automatically enriching them with email, phone numbers, LinkedIn profiles, etc.  If someone replies to my cold email or LinkedIn DM but then ghosts me, I‚Äôll follow up via call or LinkedIn sequence. I use Waalaxy to automate that part. It costs me around $149/month.  Instantly is $400/month. Calendly handles demo bookings and costs around $20/month. And Goji is free for me because I built it, so I only pay server costs.  Once a lead books a call through Calendly, it‚Äôs added to my pipeline.  I use Pipedrive to manage everything. I used to use HubSpot, but I prefer Pipedrive, it‚Äôs cheaper and simpler. When I need even more enrichment, I occasionally use Airscale, which has a solid database and a great founder behind it.  Let‚Äôs talk costs now.  Aside from Goji (free for me), my main recurring costs are Instantly, Waalaxy, Pipedrive, Calendly, domain names on GoDaddy (around $20/month), and occasionally Airscale credits. I also use a screen recording tool called Screen Studio to create high-quality product videos for socials.  Influencer marketing can get pricey. Back with Coco ai, I paid up to ‚Ç¨3000 per video. It worked, but it‚Äôs easy to burn cash fast, so be careful if you‚Äôre bootstrapping.  To sum it up: you can realistically launch and grow a SaaS with less than $1000/month in tools. If your product solves a real problem, your stack doesn‚Äôt need to be fancy.  Hope this breakdown helps. Happy to answer any questions.  Cheers  Roman"}

Then I saw research that made me question everything.  The Problem:    Products labeled \"AI-powered\" consistently lower purchase intent    68% of B2B buyers say AI tools have zero impact on buying decisions    Every tech company sounds identical with AI buzzwords    What I Discovered: One client prospect told me: \"The moment I see 'AI-powered,' I assume it doesn't work properly yet.\"  B2B buyers have seen AI promises fail. They've watched chatbots give wrong answers and \"smart\" systems make dumb mistakes. They're skeptical of vague AI claims.  What I Did Instead:    Outcome-first messaging: Instead of \"AI-powered customer segmentation,\" I wrote \"Identify highest-value prospects 73% faster with predictive analytics that analyze 12,000+ behavioral data points.\"    Specific claims: Sephora didn't market \"AI-powered messaging.\" They focused on \"personalized product replenishment alerts based on purchase history\" and saw 15% sales increase.    Invisible AI framework: Business challenge + measurable improvement + technology (mentioned last, if at all).    The Results: \"Reduce customer churn analysis from 40 hours to 4 hours per month with automated behavioral pattern detection\" performed 215% better than \"AI-powered churn prediction.\"  The Test: Remove every mention of AI from your copy. If your value proposition still makes sense, you have a winner. If not, you have a feature list.  TL;DR: B2B buyers don't care about AI buzzwords. They care about specific business outcomes. Make AI invisible while making benefits undeniable. Clarity beats cleverness every time.  CTA: Happy to answer questions or review anyone's copy here. Just reply or DM."}

I'm not here to scare you away from building something great. Some of my clients have built amazing, profitable businesses. But if you're thinking this is a quick path to passive income, you need to know what you're really signing up for.  Here's what actually happens:  The good: I've worked with founders who went from idea to $50k MRR in their first year. One client built a simple scheduling tool for dentists and now makes more than his old corporate salary. Another created an AI agent for real estate and has a waiting list of customers.  The reality: For every success story, I work with 3-4 founders who struggle. Not because their ideas are bad, but because they underestimated everything that comes after I hand over the finished product.  Month 1-3: You've just paid me to build your MVP. It works, it's beautiful, and you're excited. You launch and... now what? You realize building was the easy part. Now you need to find customers, handle support, and figure out marketing. Nobody taught you how to do sales calls or write marketing copy.  Month 4-6: The honeymoon phase ends. Customer support emails pile up and you're learning to troubleshoot user problems. You're doing sales calls during lunch breaks from your day job. Your initial excitement gets replaced by the daily grind of actually running a business.  The challenges nobody mentions:  You're not a natural marketer. You had a great idea and hired someone to build it, but now you need to convince strangers to pay for it. Writing sales emails, running ads, getting on sales calls - it's a completely different skillset.  Cashflow is unpredictable. One month you get $2k in revenue, the next month people cancel and you're back to $500. You're trying to figure out if you should hire help or keep bootstrapping.  You become everything. CEO, salesperson, customer service, marketing manager - all while probably keeping your day job. It's exhausting and you'll feel like you're bad at most of it.  Decision paralysis. Should you add more features? Focus on marketing? Raise prices? Lower prices? You're making business decisions without a business background.  What the successful founders do:  They treat it like a real business from day one. They set up proper accounting, track metrics, and make data-driven decisions instead of guessing.  They validate before they hire me. The best clients come to me with pre-orders or at least a list of people begging for the solution.  They stay financially stable. They keep their day jobs until the business actually replaces their income, not just covers expenses.  They focus obsessively. Instead of asking me to add 10 features, they perfect their sales process and customer onboarding first.  My honest take:  Building a SaaS or AI agent can be incredibly rewarding. I've seen clients gain financial freedom, build something they're proud of, and solve real problems for people.  But it's not passive income. After I deliver your product, the real work begins. You need to become a marketer, salesperson, and business operator - often while keeping your day job.  If you're okay with that learning curve and genuinely excited about solving a problem (not just making money), it can be amazing.  I love what I do because I get to help founders bring their ideas to life. Some fail, some succeed, but the ones who go in understanding that the technical build is just the beginning have the best shot.  If you're thinking about this journey, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to give you an honest assessment of your idea and what it might take to make it work.  Just remember: getting the product built is the easy part. Everything that comes after is where most people struggle."}

Failed two. Now I‚Äôm building Gojiberry ai and aiming for $1M ARR by December. Here‚Äôs my full traffic strategy.  Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Rom√†n. I‚Äôve launched four SaaS products so far:    The first one got acquired for over $1M    The next two were failures (learned a lot)    The fourth is Gojiberry ai, and it‚Äôs growing fast    Right now, 90% of my focus is on distribution. Not building.  Because in 2025, product is no longer the hard part. (It's hard but not as hard as it was)  Small teams can ship amazing tools in a few weeks. What actually makes or breaks a SaaS is distribution.  Here‚Äôs a transparent breakdown of the traffic sources I use, how I use them, and what results they bring.  1. Organic Content (LinkedIn & Reddit)  I post 3‚Äì4 times a week on LinkedIn and occasionally on Reddit.These posts generate traffic spikes and demo requests sometimes 10+ calls in a day.  Pros:    Free    Immediate feedback    High trust    Cons:    Not scalable    Not predictable unless you rank with SEO    Still, many B2B founders are doing 80% of their acquisition this way.  2. Cold Email (Volume + High Intent)  This is my top channel. I run two types of campaigns:    Broad volume campaigns ‚Üí targeting anyone interested in ‚Äúmore leads‚Äù    Hyper-targeted campaigns ‚Üí powered by Gojiberry, using buying signals like:    Liked a competitor‚Äôs post    Changed jobs    Attended a webinar    Recently raised funding      With high-intent leads, the reply rate jumps dramatically. The pitch feels natural, because timing is right.  3. LinkedIn Automation  I use Wallaxy and feed it the same high-intent leads from Gojiberry.The messages are short, personal, and sent at the right moment.I don‚Äôt blast 500 DMs, I go for precision.  This brings in a steady flow of qualified leads each week without much effort.  4. Cold Calling (Targeted Only)  Yes, I still cold call, but only leads I know are ready to talk.No random lists. I call after spotting a clear signal or trigger event.  It‚Äôs not for everyone, but if you‚Äôre comfortable with it, the close rate is excellent.  5. Partnerships & Affiliates  This one‚Äôs underrated.  I reach out to agencies or consultants who target the same audience but sell different things.We refer clients to each other or bundle offers. It works well and builds long-term relationships.  6. Paid Ads & Influencers  I haven‚Äôt scaled this yet on Gojiberry, but I did on my first SaaS (Coco ai).We ran YouTube influencer shoutouts. Results were great, but only because we had proper tracking and LTV clarity.  Paid traffic works, but only if your CAC math is solid. Otherwise, you‚Äôll burn cash fast.  7. Long-Term Plays (SEO, Resources, Tools)  I‚Äôm not investing in this yet for Gojiberry, but I did on previous projects.Free tools, SEO-optimized content, and email capture can pay off big, but it takes time and patience.

They cloned my tool and started marketing it themselves.  Upwork‚Äôs dispute process wasn‚Äôt built to handle IP theft seriously. The freelancer ghosted mediation. I had to push hard through the system to get any kind of resolution. Thankfully, I eventually did.  Lesson? For anyone building a SaaS: be extra cautious with outsourced work. Own your repos.

We'd take their lists, manually send test emails to each catch-all address, see which ones bounced, and send back the verified results.  It was tedious as hell. But it worked. And we saved thousands in development costs that we didn't know if we should spend.  And, after promoting the \"SaaS\" to outbound marketers, we made $60,000 in revenue ‚Äì before we automated a single thing.  The best part was users had no idea.

Key highlights:    Revenue reached $74,223, slightly surpassing our April record despite expecting a drop after the tax season.    Organic traffic dropped 22%, primarily due to Google‚Äôs AI-generated search updates and seasonal changes post-tax season.    Encountered a significant Google Ads bug, causing a large influx of low-quality traffic from the Philippines and Indonesia, inflating our website visits and signups.    Interestingly, Google Ads outperformed organic search for customer acquisition‚Äîa first-time occurrence.    Launched our first YouTube video, diversifying channels amid uncertainty around Google‚Äôs evolving search strategy.    Approximately 10% of intro calls attributed their discovery of SavvyNomad to ChatGPT and other AI tools, indicating an emerging acquisition channel.

Google Ads: Discovered highly effective Performance Max campaigns targeting competitor website visitors (yes, you can do it), achieving an exceptionally low CAC (~$15 per subscription). Still managing the fallout from the traffic-quality bug.    YouTube: Released our first video after overcoming significant production delays.

In SaaS, critical emails simply can‚Äôt miss ‚Äì from welcoming users, resetting passwords, to sending updates and marketing. Yet I often come across questions like¬†‚ÄúHow do I improve deliverability?‚Äù,¬†‚ÄúWhy are my emails going to spam?‚Äù, and similar. To help answer these, I put together a clear, practical checklist of email deliverability best practices specifically tailored for SaaS startups. I hope you find it useful. 1. Domain reputation Providers evaluate sender reputation primarily at the domain level. This persists even if you change IPs or providers. Signals include spam complaints, bounce rates, sending volume consistency, engagement metrics, and authentication success. 2. Authenticate emails (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) Set up SPF and DKIM records to verify sending rights and attach cryptographic signatures. Provider filters heavily rely on these. Adding DMARC protects against spoofing. 3. Choose a reliable sending infrastructure Prefer ESPs or services with strong inbox placement records. Recommended: Sidemail (focused on SaaS, handles authentication, warm-up, and deliverability automatically), Mailgun (developer-focused, with advanced analytics and validation tools), SendGrid (Twilio) (widely used, with strong support for both transactional and marketing emails), Amazon SES (cost-effective and scalable, ideal for teams willing to manage setup) 4. Warm up new domains/IPs Start with low volume and gradually increase. Send to highly engaged users first to build positive signals during the warm‚Äëup phase. 5. Separate transactional and marketing emails Send transactional emails from a dedicated domain or IP to protect them from the higher-risk marketing traffic. 6. Maintain a clean, opt-in list Use opt-in only, avoid third-party or scraped addresses. Regularly prune disengaged users and remove hard-bounces. 7. Create relevant, engaging content Segment content for relevance, use real reply-to addresses (avoid ‚Äúno-reply‚Äù), and include clear unsubscribe options. Quality content boosts engagement and signals value to providers. 8. Monitor deliverability metrics Track engagement, bounce, and complaint rates. Early detection allows quick remediation.  I'd say deliverability is both art and science. Have you ever faced any deliverability issues with your project?"}

We were getting a steady stream of customer questions that, honestly, had simple answers, things like how to find a feature that was already documented somewhere else. The issue wasn‚Äôt the lack of answers, it was how often we had to repeat them.  Instead of answering the same questions again and again, we created a help center where we could drop a link and move on. It shifted support from reactive to proactive and let us focus our limited energy elsewhere.  Yes, it takes upfront effort. But in a lean team, it‚Äôs often the best way to protect your future bandwidth.  If you‚Äôre looking to reduce the actual time and effort it takes, try using tools like Clueso to make these videos, and Slab or Notion to host it. It doesnt need to built from scratch.  Curious how others handled this: When did you know it was time to build a help center? And how did you justify the time investment?"}

But this one from last month still makes me mad lol.  Had a client last month who thought they were being smart by hiring some cheap support person instead of handling customer emails themselves.  Worst decision ever lol.  What Happened  Potential customer asks a pretty basic question about integrations. Support person sends some generic copy-paste response that doesn't even make sense.  Customer tries again with more details. Gets another useless template response.  Third email from customer: \"nevermind, going with your competitor.\"  Plot twist: this wasn't just any customer. It was gonna be their biggest client yet. Like $2k/month type deal.  Why This Stuff Matters  Support isn't just about fixing bugs. It's literally how people decide if they trust ur product or not.  I've seen terrible products with great support absolutely destroy better competitors. People will put up with so much shit if they know someone actually gives a damn about helping them.  What Actually Works  The clients who nail this do a few things:    Actually read the question before responding (shocking concept)    Respond same day, not \"within 48 hours\"    Sometimes just hop on a quick call instead of 10 back-and-forth emails    Don't act like helping customers is annoying af    Real Talk  Good support literally prints money. Happy customers stick around longer, refer friends, leave good reviews. Bad support kills everything before u even realize what's happening.  One client started spending more time on support and their churn dropped by like 60%. That's insane ROI.  Bottom Line  Don't cheap out on support, especially early on.

By Wednesday i had something that actually churned out js snippets. it was messy and far from perfect but you could tell it kinda worked. i spent thursday tweaking the main flows and Friday, i wrote a simple landing page with a buy button  over the weekend, i shared it on a few slack groups and tweeted a gif of the generator at work. Surprisingly someone asked if they could use it for their side project. i sent them a quick demo link and they tried it out. On Monday morning, they messaged me that they'd pay $5,000 if I handed over the code and license. i nearly spit out my coffee  i zipped up the repo, sent them an invoice, and transferred the ownership. all in under seven days. no fancy launch, no marketing budget. just a raw idea turned into something someone actually paid for. Feels wild, but proof that you can build and sell if you just ship something that works.  Being a founder is an awesome job!"}

Are we monitoring citations and mentions from AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, etc.?    Should we change how we write blogs, similar to landing pages? More structured?

Great product, 2 years in market, stuck at $12K MRR, classic story. His solution helped restaurants manage inventory. He was charging $89/month and had about 130 customers, decent retention, good reviews, but growth had flatlined.  The problem wasn't  pricing, positioning, or product-market fit, it was math.  He was spending 3-4 hours per customer to close a $89/month deal. Let's do the math 4 hours of his time, customer acquisition cost $800+ in time alone, monthly revenue: $89, time to break even: 9+ months, his sales capacity: 2-3 deals per week maximum  The fix was simple. Instead of selling to individual restaurants, we started selling to restaurant groups. One conversation = 5-15 locations,deal size: $400-1200/month instead of $89 and his time investment: Same 3-4 hours  Results after 8 months MRR grew from $12K to $50K, customer count stayed roughly the same,average deal size $390/month and sales cycle 30% faster  Sometimes you don't need more customers. You need better customers.  Before you rebuild your product or hire salespeople, ask yourself: \"Am I selling $100 solutions to people who have $1000 problems?\"  Most SaaS founders are fishing in kiddie pools when there's an ocean right next to them.

Every so often, they release a new feature that overlaps with what we're doing, and it's easy to get anxious or feel like we're being encroached on.  That got me thinking:  Should startups always be worried when a big incumbent releases a similar feature?  Is it smarter to just focus on a specific vertical, go deep, and ignore the competition?  How do you know when to respond and when to stay focused?  Curious to hear how others have dealt with this. How do you stay confident in your roadmap and positioning when a giant is hovering over the market?  Thanks."}

I Launched it. Dreamed of users flooding in.Result? Zero dollars. Zero users. Who ever very few people used it and they literally felt their pain has been taken away in the Design.  Here‚Äôs what I wish I‚Äôd known before wasting nearly a year of my life. The Mistakes That Crushed Me:    No Validation: Built what I thought was awesome, not what users wanted. Never asked a soul if they‚Äôd use it.    Feature Overload: Kept adding ‚Äúone more cool thing‚Äù for 8 months. Ended up with a bloated prototype.    Perfection Trap: Spent weeks tweaking code and designs nobody ever saw. I was my own worst critic.    Zero Marketing: Believed ‚Äúbuild it, and they‚Äôll come.‚Äù Spoiler: They didn‚Äôt. I had no followers, no audience.    Ignored Reality: Didn‚Äôt check if anyone else was solving this. No One but YOU NEED To HAVE EYEBALLS for category creation/revolutionary App, which nobody expects that design can be done without template    The Brutal Reality:    300+ days grinding on InfographsAI.    $0 in revenue. Not a single cent.    Lost countless nights and weekends, plus $20,000 of my savings.    What I Built: InfographsAII‚Äôm an engineer with 15+ years at Walmart, Visa, and Target as Engineering Architect, now a solopreneur chasing SaaS dreams. Sick of 2017‚Äôs clunky, Same old template-based infographic tools (Canva, Visme, I‚Äôm looking at you) that took 3+ hours for mediocre results, I built InfographsAI‚Äîan AI-powered platform that makes infographics fast, unique, and client-ready. Here‚Äôs what it does:    Any Input, Instant Output: Feed it YouTube URLs, PDFs, websites, images, text, or data files (few are in beta). AI extracts insights and builds the entire infographic‚Äîlayout, fonts, colors, charts, visuals‚Äîin under 200 seconds.    No Templates, Ever: Every design is 100% custom for your content. Say goodbye to cookie-cutter Canva clones.    6 Art Styles: Cartoon, Pixar, Anime, Storybook, Vector, Minimalist. Make your visuals stand out.    Smart Features: Auto fact-checking to avoid data blunders. SmartGraph for real-time charts. Normal or Sarcastic tone modes.    Global Reach: Works in 35+ languages with cultural awareness.    How It Works:    Drop in any content.    Choose style and tone.    Get a publication-ready infographic in seconds‚Äîno design skills needed.    What I‚Äôm Learning (Too Late):    Validate Early: Talk to 10-20 potential users before coding. I‚Äôm starting now‚ÄîDM me for beta access!    Build Fast: Launch an MVP in 6 weeks, not 10 months. Core features only.    Market Day 1: Build an audience while coding. I‚Äôm at 0 followers but hustling to change that.    Focus on Users: Get people using it before adding more features.    Set Deadlines: Ship even if it‚Äôs not perfect. I waited too long.    The Turnaround (Kinda):InfographsAI is live, but I‚Äôm still at $0 and 0 users because I have no audience (yet!). But beta testers loved it‚Äîone said it turned a dense PDF into a Pixar-style infographic in 180 seconds. It‚Äôs a start. I‚Äôm now talking to potential users and posting here to build a following.  Mindset Shift:  Stop thinking like a coder (‚ÄúHow can I make this perfect?‚Äù). Start thinking like a hustler (‚ÄúHow do I get users to care?‚Äù).Start Buidling Community Before you start Actual coding, start talking early about your product . Nobody warned me how easy it is to spend 10 months building something nobody knows exists.  Question: Ever built something that flopped hard? What mistakes did you make? Spill the tea below!"}

So I've been freelancing for about 4 years now, mostly helping early stage SaaS founders build their MVPs and figure out customer acquisition. I've seen some founders nail their first 10 customers in weeks, while others struggle for months with the same exact product. Thought I'd share what I've learned since a lot of you are asking about this stuff.  The stuff that actually works:    Start with your network, seriously - I know it sounds basic but every successful founder I've worked with got at least 3-4 of their first customers from people they already knew. Don't be weird about it tho, only reach out to people who actually have the problem you're solving    Cold email still works if you're not lazy - But please stop sending \"Hi, I have a revolutionary solution...\" emails. Research the person, mention something specific about their company, and ask about their current process before pitching anything    Build ONE thing really well - The founders who succeed focus on solving one specific problem perfectly. The ones who fail try to build everything at once. I've literally seen startups with 50+ features get beaten by apps that do ONE thing amazingly    Price it right from day 1 - Don't give your product away for free hoping people will upgrade later. If someone won't pay $30/month for something that saves them 10 hours, they probably don't have a real problem. Start at like 80% of competitor pricing max    Join communities where your customers hang out - But don't spam! I've seen founders get their first customers just by being helpful in Slack groups and LinkedIn communities for months before ever mentioning their product    What doesn't work (learned this the hard way):    Social media ads for early customers - waste of money unless you have serious budget    Building features before talking to customers - obvious but somehow everyone does this    Focusing on competitors instead of customers    Perfectionism - your MVP doesn't need to look like Notion lol    The biggest mistake I see: Founders thinking they need to scale marketing before they even know if people want their product. Like, worry about Facebook ads when you have 100 customers, not when you have zero.  One more thing - if you can't get 10 people to pay for your SaaS within 3 months of launching, you probably don't have product-market fit yet. Don't keep building features, go talk to more customers.  Been working on a few projects lately where founders finally \"got it\" and went from 0 to 15 customers in 6 weeks after struggling for months. It's usually about focus and actually talking to people, not the tech stack or fancy features.  Anyone else been through this grind? What worked for you?"}

So I want to offer a different perspective: a deep dive into the engineering decisions I made while building my first SaaS, and why I chose a path that many would call \"over-engineered.\"  This is a long one, so grab a coffee.  So, what do I mean by \"over-engineered\"? Let's be clear about what this isn't. This isn't a mess of dozens of microservices, a complex CQRS pattern, or me trying to build my own authentication. It‚Äôs not complexity for the sake of it.  For me, over-engineering was a conscious choice to shift from the typical startup mindset of \"ship features at all costs\" to \"with a little extra time, could I build something that scales more elegantly and remains stable for longer?\"  I approached building my app, Linksie, as if I were the CTO of the company. That meant building and laying down technological foundations for additional scale. If I were to bring on new engineers, what kind of sustainable and scalable foundation would I want in place?  Here‚Äôs how that philosophy turned out.  The Codebase: A Monorepo  The entire project lives in a single monorepo, which keeps things organized. It's broken down into:  Application Services:    NextJS Web App (Pages Router) for the front end.    HonoJS API for the backend.    Libraries: BetterAuth (auth), Tailwind & Headless UI (UI/UX), Tanstack Query/Form (state management), and Stripe (payments).    Everything is containerized in Docker.    Worker Services:    A dedicated service for database migrations.    A job task worker to handle asynchronous tasks like our referral system.    Shared Packages:    This holds reusable code, primarily my database client interfaces for PostgreSQL and Redis, so both the API and the workers can use them consistently.    I'm already pushing 30k lines of code. This isn't meant to be a flex or anything, it's just to give you a relative point for size.  The SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle)I wanted a smooth, professional development process from day one.    Local Dev: The entire stack spins up locally with a single docker-compose up command.    CI/CD: When code gets merged to main, a GitHub Actions pipeline automatically kicks off. It builds, tests, deploys all changes, and applies database migrations to a dedicated staging environment.    Production: After verifying everything on staging, I can trigger a manual deployment to production right from the GitHub UI. Is it a bit much for one person? Absolutely.    The Infrastructure (All Code, All Cloud)  This is where things get really \"extra.\" About 90% of my infrastructure is declared in Terraform. I debated between AWS and GCP but ultimately chose Google Cloud because I love Cloud Run for its auto-scaling capabilities.  Here‚Äôs the stack:  Cloud Run: For both my main services and background jobs. I can set min/max instances, and it handles the rest. Cloud SQL: A managed Postgres database. Memorystore: A managed Redis instance for caching. Cloud Load Balancer, Cloud DNS & VPC: To manage traffic securely. Secrets Manager & Artifact Registry: For credentials and container images. Outside of GCP, I'm using Cloudflare for DNS handling and their R2 Buckets.  Why go through all this trouble for an app with $0 revenue?.  I know what you're thinking. \"This is insane. You could have built this for a fraction of the cost and time using Vercel, Supabase, etc.\" And you're right.  But my reasons were simple:  1-I Despise Vendor Lock-in.  Companies like Vercel are doing amazing things for the ecosystem. But at the end of the day, they are for-profit entities, and there are signs they might prioritize profits over developer experience. We've all seen the horror stories of insane, unexpected bills. We preach that clean, modular code is the way to go; I believe that should apply to your systems too. Owning my stack gives me freedom and predictability.  2-This Was a Huge Opportunity for Growth.  I'm primarily a full-stack product engineer. I understood infrastructure conceptually, but I‚Äôd never had to get my hands dirty setting up containers, VPCs, or deploying infrastructure-as-code. This project forced me to fill a massive gap in my skillset. The counter-argument is \"just hire someone later,\" but how can you effectively hire for a role you know nothing about? How do you know good from bad?  Even if Linksie completely flops, I have zero regrets. The amount I learned about DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and building a robust system from the ground up has been invaluable. What am I doing next? Aggressively trying to hunt down customers. Even though I have a full time job that can cover costs, there's certainly some pressure of trying to make $$ when you're paying a pretty hefty amount of $$ for infra costs.  If I launched another SaaS now would I do the exact same thing? Not exactly. There's several things I'd definitely reuse like Google Cloud Run, Terraform, Secrets manager and probably same frontend/backend setup. But I'd definitely reconsider how my data layer is setup. Drop the Redis Cache (overkill), find a cheaper way to manage the Postgres DB, and then drop the staging environment. These are probably the biggest cost drivers right now in this application  I'd totally encourage people to continue to build their skillsets and look for gaps where they can grow. AI really helps with amplifying that. I knew zero Terraform code and picked it up pretty quickly over 4-5 days.  Anyhow, hope this was an interesting read among the sea of promotion posts. I did drop Linksie here, but the target market isn't really related to the visitors of this subreddit at all  Would love to hear your thoughts. Do you stick to the lean-and-mean approach, or have you ever found value in \"over-engineering\" a project for the sake of learning and future-proofing? Happy to also answer any \"tech\" questions you might have."}

Our churn is 8%! We need to get it down to 3%!  But here's what I see at every struggling SaaS I work with: they're not losing customers because their product sucks. They're losing customers because their customers can't afford to keep paying  You're selling $50/month software to freelancers who make $1000/month. You're selling $200/month tools to startups burning through their last $10k. You're selling enterprise features to companies that should be using spreadsheets.  The uncomfortable truth low churn doesn't matter if your customers are fundamentally unable to pay long-term  I've watched companies celebrate 2% monthly churn while their customers are literally going out of business. Meanwhile, companies selling $500/month to profitable businesses barely worry about churn because their customers make money using the product  What actually matters  - can your customer make/save more money using your product than they pay you?  - Are they profitable enough that your fee is noise, not a burden?  - Do they have a budget specifically for tools like yours?  The pattern I see everywhere struggling saas sells cheap to cash-poor customers, fights churn constantly and thriving saas sells expensive to cash-rich customers, churn becomes irrelevant  Stop trying to make broke people less broke. Start finding people who already have money and help them make more of it.  Your churn problem isn't a product problem. It's a customer selection problem  Hope it helps"}

That‚Äôs 7 months of effort for $20.  It was incredibly hard to reach that point, and it was the greatest feeling in the world.  But once you go from 0 ‚Üí 1, something changes.  1 month after getting my first paying customer, I hit $1,300.  3 months after, $4,500  6 months after, $16,500  8 months after, $33,000  In the beginning you have to fight for those first users and paying customers.  The market is crowded, competitive, and you have no social proof or following. Getting your message through all this noise is not easy.  But eventually someone gives your product a shot. One user grows to a few, you get a little bit of social proof for your product, and it becomes easier for new people to try it.  If you serve your first customers well, listen to their feedback, and help them solve their problems, they will begin recommending you to others.  And just like that, real growth begins.  You also know your target audience better now, which marketing channels worked, and where you should double down.  It gets easier.  My ‚Äúgame plan‚Äù was simple:    I kept taking daily action even when I was met with silence, no new signups, and rejections in DMs.    At the end of each day, I looked back on what I had done and wrote down one thing I would improve the next day.    Then I implemented the improvement, and kept going.    If you‚Äôre in the 0 ‚Üí 1 phase right now, you just have to keep going.  I know that it‚Äôs hard right now.

Building AI tools with AI to build AI SaaS.  Makes sense - it looks cool and sounds cool.  But all we see is outliers - dev influencers that manage to pull it off just because they have an audience.  But here‚Äôs the thing no one tells you: if you don‚Äôt already have an audience or a decent marketing budget, it's probably not gonna work out the way you hope.  Even if you build something decent, by the time you get any traction, there is high probability that a better-funded or more visible version will already be out there.  What I've learned is that AI is way more powerful when you use it behind the scenes - to build tools for people who don't even know what AI is. People who don‚Äôt care about Claude, GPT-4 or APIs, they just want to solve a problem and save time. That's where it clicks and that's how you get a customer.  Look for niches that most likely will require hand-holding for customer. The more essential tool, the less churn and long-term business.  I'm not saying building AI tools is bad, I think isn't some kind of ticket to success. If you should use AI, use it in boring niche."}

They'd been hovering around $80k MRR for almost 2 years. Founders were smart, product was solid, but sales just weren't happening. First thing I noticed - their entire sales team was focused on features. Every demo was a 45-minute product walkthrough. Prospects would nod along, say it looks great, then disappear.  Here's what we changed:  Month 1-2: Stopped doing product demos Sounds crazy but we banned demos for 60 days. Instead, sales calls became pure discovery. \"Tell me about your current process. What's frustrating about it. What happens when that breaks down.\"  Conversion from first call to second call went from 23% to 67%.  Month 3-4: Rebuilt their entire qualification process They were talking to anyone with a pulse. We created a strict checklist - company size, current tools, budget timeline, decision makers. If prospects didn't meet 4/5 criteria, we'd refer them to competitors.  Sounds mean but their sales cycle dropped from 4.5 months to 2.1 months.  Month 5-7: Fixed their pricing strategy They had one price: $99/user/month. Period. No flexibility.  We created 3 tiers and added annual discounts. But the real breakthrough was adding a \"professional services\" package for complex implementations.  Average deal size jumped from $1,200 to $4,800.  Month 8-12: Focused on expansion revenue Realized their best customers were only using about 30% of available features. Started monthly check-ins to help customers get more value.  Existing customer revenue grew 180% without any new features.  Month 13-14: Built a referral system that actually works Instead of asking happy customers for referrals, we started introducing them to each other. Created a private Slack community.  Referral revenue went from basically zero to 40% of new business.  Current MRR: $340k and growing about 15% monthly.  The weird part? We barely touched their product. Everything was sales process, positioning, and customer success.  Anyone else found that sales problems usually aren't product problems?"}

This startup is all around the social media growth, like on X, Linkedin, Bsky and Reddit, i knew that are lots of people doing that so i had to stand out, and when i made a small research, i found out that they all use Al wrapper, so i made my SaaS all built around my own exp, YES, it uses Al but only to form events in roadmaps with the huge prompts i have for eevry case scenario.  Okay, so here are the tips i can share for those who starts!  Firstly you need to find out where is your target audience, for me it was all founders/people who needed roadmaps and marketing on those 4 socials, i found them mostly on X.  Secondly, build personal brand, post good content, share wins and failures, be transparent, i got my first sale from a friend i made online there lol  Thirdly, give free access to 5 people before the launch, so they can test it, i did it, made huge fixes and improvements, + got real people reviews (no need to fake)  Finally, try to reach out to every client and keep in touch, add features and fix stuff as they come  Basically thats it, i wanna say that founders, build solutions around your own problems, and no matter what bimbos out there say, try it, at least there is no regret :)  P.s to prove my revenue here are the screenshots - https://postimg.cc/gallery/64yGJkF"}

I have a technical co-founder ‚Äî a top-tier engineer ‚Äî and we‚Äôre constantly bouncing around ideas. Most of them are rooted in real-life problems we face in both our work and personal lives. Some ideas get tossed because they‚Äôre too expensive or complex (usually, they come together). Others make it through ‚Äî they get built and launched.  But this is exactly where our conveyor belt breaks ‚Äî we consistently fail at product distribution.  One example:We built an AI companion aimed at helping people overcome self-doubt and regain confidence ‚Äî essentially, something to remind you that you‚Äôre okay and keep you going. We spent countless hours fine-tuning the prompts to make sure the tone felt supportive and human, not robotic. We launched it in a lightweight format via messenger ‚Äî super accessible, low friction.  And we got great feedback ‚Äî relatively speaking, for the size of our user base. People liked it. The idea resonated. We saw similar projects raising funding with this exact concept.  But we couldn‚Äôt get it off the ground.  We just didn‚Äôt know how to promote it without spending heavily on traffic. So, eventually, we killed it.  And that pattern keeps repeating.  We‚Äôre both exhausted by this loop, and I really want to break it.  So I‚Äôm reaching out for your insights:  1. How do you approach marketing with zero budget?2.

I don't get how everyone here is building and launching so many things. I see new posts every day.  I'm working on a SaaS idea right now. It's a balancing act between building things \"right\" and building things \"fast\" and I'm pretty aware of all the tradeoffs I'm making. But it'll take ~3-4 months to build our MVP (we know it's a validated market already and have some potential clients already).  Is this the normal workflow? Am I just under the wrong impression that people are spinning up working apps much quicker than me? Or are people just throwing products out there that are constantly breaking?  Are all these apps \"vibe-coded\" or built with no/low-code tools where the owners have little control over what's going out?  Edit: Thanks for all the comments y'all! This blew up way more than expected. Tons of different opinions here too. My takeaway is that MVPs range from 1 week - 6 months, but super dependent on the project. I think this makes a lot of sense. I've gone through a lot of other posts recently and feel like this aligns; a lot of the quicker things are simpler LLM wrappers or single-function-utilities without a ton of depth. My project is a full platform we're building and MVP, even after scaling down a lot, is just more complex and requires more time. Yes, AI helps a ton and should be a tool that is actively used (and is).  I think the quicker & smaller stuff just gets broadcasted more often, leading to the original feelings of being slower than peers in this space."}

Growing a product still takes a lot of work of course, but you don‚Äôt run into the same impenetrable wall when trying to market it.  I believe that building products without demand is just a simple mistake new founders make because you don‚Äôt know better in the beginning.

If you want to take the randomness out of the process and maximize your chances of reaching that $10K MRR product, there‚Äôs only one approach. This approach focuses on finding real demand before sinking months into a product.  Here‚Äôs that approach that I used myself:  1. Begin by finding a problem from your own experience you'd pay to fix:    What‚Äôs something that‚Äôs caused you pain, or is currently causing you pain in your personal life? If it affects you, chances are it‚Äôs affecting others too.    What problems do you experience at work? What problems do you already get paid to solve?    What are your passions? Since you spend a lot on time and energy on your passions I bet you‚Äôre also pretty familiar with the problems you encounter in them.    Goal: identify a problem you care about enough that you‚Äôd pay for a solution to it.  2. Create a simple solution concept  Chances are as soon as you find a problem you care about, you also get some ideas for how it could be solved. You don‚Äôt need a fully fleshed out product idea. You just need a solution concept that can be presented to your target audience so they understand it.  Goal: create simple solution concept that can be presented to your target audience.  3. Talk to your target audience to validate the problem and confirm demand  Reach out to your network. If you don‚Äôt have a network, Reddit is a great place to get in touch with people of every niche (there‚Äôs pretty much a subreddit for everyone). Create a post focused on feedback, not promotion, and offer people something in return for responding.  Find out four things:    Do they experience the problem?    How does it impact them?    How are they currently solving it?    Would they pay for a solution?    Important note: ask about past behavior when digging into this. Many people will say they would do one thing, but they act a completely different way. E.g. saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm disciplined and committed to working out.‚Äù then when you dig into past behavior it turns out that during the last month they only went to the gym once a week.  Goal: validate that the problem is real and that people are willing to pay for a solution.  4. Ship MVP  Now that you have a validated problem, don‚Äôt waste months building a fully fleshed out product. Ship the simplest version of your solution that delivers value to your target audience. A good product is created through experimentation and feedback from your target customers. I‚Äôve gone through countless changes myself from when I started building my product to where it is now at 9,000 users. Slowly but surely you find your way to what works.  Important note: don‚Äôt lose sight of the problem and your vision when receiving feedback though. Everyone has different needs and some suggestions will simply be irrelevant and will just risk derailing your product. Always keep the main problem you‚Äôre solving in mind, strive to solve it in the best way possible, and filter all the feedback through that.  Goal: get your product in front of your target audience as quickly as possible to start receiving the valuable feedback you need.  I hope this was helpful to you as a newer founder.  It made all the difference for me so I just wanted to do my part and share it with you because it‚Äôs what I would‚Äôve needed when starting out.  Let me know if you have any questions.  For the curious, my SaaS is called Buildpad"}

My SaaS product just made its first $100, and I‚Äôm over the moon in excitement.  A Little Backstory: I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns üòÖ). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?  But last night, as I was about to go to bed, I got¬†the notification.¬†You know the one ‚Äì \"You've received a payment of $19.‚Äù Although it didn‚Äôt seem like much, I checked my Stripe account and there it was, the big 100. It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.  What My Product Does: The product is a¬†Reddit marketing/growth tool¬†that helps people grow their product more on Reddit. It‚Äôs not a spam tool or anything like that, but it helps make the right type of posts so you can get some engagement, and it also has lead generation so you can find potential customers that way. It‚Äôs aimed at small founders, businesses, marketers, and anyone who wants an easier way to grow on Reddit. And clearly, there‚Äôs at least one person out there who saw enough value to subscribe!  Why This Means So Much to Me: I‚Äôm not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don‚Äôt have a fancy office or a huge team. It‚Äôs just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $100 is so much more than just money, it‚Äôs validation. It‚Äôs proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I‚Äôve built to actually pay for it.  What‚Äôs Next? For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it‚Äôs time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let‚Äôs see how far this can go. Thanks for reading, and if you‚Äôve been grinding on your own project, let‚Äôs hear about it in the comments. Let‚Äôs inspire each other. You can check my product here:¬†https://www.tydal.co"}

For months, I had no social life, progress felt slow, and I completely burnt out. I love building, but the marketing part is super unpredictable and draining. Nothing I did seemed to work, and honestly, I was feeling pretty blue in the end of the day.  I took a few days off, spent some time with my girlfriend, stared at a wall, and had a realization that my problem was trying to do everything myself.  I decided to delegate one task at a time, I focused on the 3 channels that actually got me users: Blog Posts, Brand Placements, and Organic Content.  I started with blog, my process is simple but effective:(a bit unethical)  I find high-quality, relevant articles from writers on medium and substack that is relevant to my product. I feed them into Gemini 2.5 Pro with a prompt to rewrite the core concepts for my site's audience. I run the output through AI text humanizer to change the robotic tone and ai lingo. Lastly I did a bit of manual editing to inject my own tone and examples. I get decent organic traffic for about 20 minutes of work per post.  ps. If you just copy-paste from an AI, Google‚Äôs crawlers detect it somehow and won‚Äôt index it.  A bit of after-touch is very useful.  2. Brand Placements I tried building a DIY workflow with social media APIs to get my product mentioned in relevant threads, but it is a freaking nightmare. It is fragile, high-maintenance, and the Twitter API alone was going to be $200/month.  I switched to a tool called Mentio. It automatically places product mentions where people are looking for similar solutions in all socials. I just spend a few minutes at the end of the day reviewing the mentions and giving the algo feedback to sharpen its aim and outputs.  3. Organic Content This part is still a mess. I've tried a bunch of tools that overpromise and underdeliver:  ReelFarm for UGC TikToks (good, not for me) A dozen others I won't name The core problem is most tools still require constant input. You have to come up with ideas, edit, and deal with broken schedulers. Right now, I only actively use Typefully to organize tweets, but it's still manual labor.  I haven't found a tool that can take one of my blog posts and properly repurpose it into a full content suite: a Twitter thread, a LinkedIn post, a Reddit discussion starter, and a TikTok script. (If you know something like that shoot me a DM please)  Whoever builds that properly will print money. It's a heavy-lift product, but the demand is massive.  No gatekeeping here, happy to chat about my stack or process!"}

You must talk to everyone who books onto your calendar (inbound or outbound), regardless of quality.  What most people fail to understand with growing revenue is that everything is a massive funnel.  You'll talk to X people, Y of them will be a decent fit, and Z of them will become paying customers.  Yet so many business owners under $250k/month cut off their funnel at the top by trying to qualify leads ahead of time.¬†As a result, they don't scale because they don't talk to enough people to begin with.  The \"Y\" and \"Z\" portions of the funnel get smaller because the business owner is artificially limiting the amount of people who enter the funnel to begin with.  This is the wrong way to go. I'm willing to bet that certain agency owners who do this have shut themselves off from potential paying customers because of their ego.  Only once you pass $250,000 per month of revenue can you start getting selective about who you spend your time talking to."}

But I wanted to map the exact evolution of their growth strategies, not just what they did but when, why, and how each stage built on the last.  So I spent the last few days digging into what strategies they used to grow and how those strategies changed with time. Specifically:    How did they get their first few customers?    What changed when they moved from zero to early traction?    How did their go-to-market shift after product‚Äìmarket fit?    How did they scale once they had momentum?

Started at $10/day each, then scaled to $50/day after three weeks.    Campaign 1 targeted r/LinkedInLunatics. Big reach, low quality.    Campaign 2 targeted r/LinkedInAds. Small subreddit, very relevant audience.    Campaign 3 used keyword targeting for ‚ÄúLinkedIn Ads.‚Äù More volume, mid-level intent.    After 20 days, we made two key changes.  First, we switched to feed-only placement for subreddit targeting and conversation-only for keyword targeting.  Second, we replaced r/LinkedInLunatics with r/b2bmarketing to improve relevance.  Here‚Äôs how the 45-day test performed:    r/LinkedInAds got 2,100 impressions, 48 clicks, and 9 signups. CTR was 2.3%, CPC was $1.75, and signup rate was 18.7%.    The keyword campaign had 86,000 impressions, 213 clicks, and 6 signups. CTR was 0.25%, CPC was $0.80, and signup rate was 2.8%.    r/b2bmarketing had 74,000 impressions, 181 clicks, and 2 signups. CTR was 0.24%, CPC was $0.45, and signup rate was 1.1%.    In total, we spent around $2,000 and got 17 signups. That‚Äôs about $117 per signup.  What actually worked?    Feed placement drove most of the clicks.    Niche targeting on r/LinkedInAds brought the highest quality traffic.    What didn‚Äôt work?    Keyword targeting brought traffic but lacked intent.    Broad subreddits looked efficient on paper but didn‚Äôt convert.    Scaling was tough: the best subreddits just didn‚Äôt have enough reach.    If I ran this again, I‚Äôd focus only on hyper-relevant subreddits. I‚Äôd invest more time in testing creative that looks like organic posts.  This experiment didn‚Äôt flood us with signups, but it gave us a clear view of Reddit‚Äôs potential.  It‚Äôs not plug-and-play, but if you‚Äôre in B2B SaaS and willing to test, Reddit can be a decent early-stage discovery channel."}

Let me explain;  Software has been by far the most lucrative and scalable type of business in the last decades. 7 out of the 10 richest people in the world got their wealth from software products. This is why software engineers are paid so much too.  But at the same time software was one of the hardest spaces to break into. Becoming a good enough programmer to build stuff had a high learning curve. Months if not years of learning and practice to build something decent. And it was either that or hiring an expensive developer; often unresponsive ones that stretched projects for weeks and took whatever they wanted to complete it.  When chatGpt came out we saw a glimpse of what was coming. But people I personally knew were in denial. Saying that llms would never be able to be used to build real products or production level apps. They pointed out the small context window of the first models and how they often hallucinated and made dumb mistakes. They failed to realize that those were only the first and therefore worst versions of these models we were ever going to have.  We now have models with 1 Millions token context windows that can reason and make changes to entire code bases. We have tools like AppAlchemy that prototype apps in seconds and AI first code editors like Cursor that allow you move 10x faster. Every week I‚Äôm seeing people on twitter that have vibe coded and monetized entire products in a matter of weeks, people that had never written a line of code in their life.  We‚Äôve crossed a threshold where software creation is becoming completely democratized. Smartphones with good cameras allowed everyone to become a content creator. LLMs are doing the same thing to software, and it's still so early."}

However, it had clearly been abandoned. No updates, bug fixes, and tons of user requests piling up.  And yet, people were still using it. They wanted it to work.  So I decided to build my own version. Something cleaner with more features. But most importantly, shaped by real user feedback.  I launched in December. No ads, no growth hacks. Just dropped it in a few communities and started talking to early users.  At first, it was VERY rough. People would sign up, poke around, then disappear. But I kept asking why. Every bit of feedback became a tweak, a fix, or sometimes a total rework. Slowly, it started clicking. A few users stuck. Then more.  Whenever I got good feedback from a user, I‚Äôd ask if I could feature it on the landing page. That became my first real bit of social proof. On my landing page, those quotes are from people who used the product and saw value. These early trust signals helped turn visitors into paying users. A bonus hack for this, is too get testimonials from reputable people in your space. That testimonial is worth many times more than a regular, in a potential users eyes.  Now, six months later, it's passed 900 signups!! People are even buying the yearly plan, sometimes within an hour of trying it. That‚Äôs been wild to see, as i didn't expect people to purchase without using their full 14 day trial.  What I‚Äôve learned: early on, it‚Äôs hard to see if your efforts are going anywhere. But if you keep showing up and improving your product, even just a little each day... you‚Äôll eventually wake up to something people genuinely love. And want to pay for.  my process has been simple, but effective: build, share, listen, fix, repeat.  happy to help with any questions you have, i've learned a thing or two :)"}

So I made one small change.I started sending a short, human-written email after launch with:  - A personal thank you  - How many people viewed their product  - A nudge to come back and upvote others  - An invite to reply if they had questions or feedback  That‚Äôs it.

What worked:    Building in public on X / Twitter. I shared the process from scratch: feature updates, small wins, even bugs. Didn't have a big audience at all. It helped build trust and also gave visibility to the right crowd. No big following needed, just consistency and transparency.

That worked well to push early users to take the deal without overthinking.    Word of mouth (surprising win!) Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it. But people loved the tool and started recommending it. Around 20% of my revenue came just from user referrals.    What didn't work    LinkedIn posts I was super consistent (3x/week), and some posts hit 10K+ impressions. But... 0 conversions.

Got about 50 replies, 2-3 paying users... And no sales. Not worth the time/energy at this stage.    LinkedIn and Twitter cold DMs Tried reaching out to potential users one by one. No results.    Affiliate marketing I thought signing my first users would make it easier to bring in affiliates. But activating affiliates is a job on its own. And actually, none got interested in actively promoting the product at this stage.    Next steps:  The experiment is still on.  SEO is what I‚Äôm now betting on mid/long term.  I‚Äôve seen great results from my SEO blogging strategy in past projects. So I‚Äôm using my own tool (of course right) to publish daily blogs, and I‚Äôm working on adding a smart backlink exchange feature to it grow authority.  Also will try paid ads and youtube videos soon, will report!  Best of luck builders!"}

We‚Äôve built our business around their CRM and Sales Hub tools, and for the most part, the platform has worked well for us.  But recently, something happened that really shook my trust.  Out of nowhere, our account was upgraded to Sales Hub Professional, but we were only given 1 sales seat ‚Äî despite previously having 5 seats under Sales Hub Starter. On top of that, our group meeting scheduling link was deleted, which has directly caused us to lose two full days of client appointments (a real financial hit).  I reached out to our rep, and he told me this is a system-wide update affecting all customers. But here‚Äôs where it gets sticky:  Earlier this year, I raised a similar issue to Yamini Rangan, the CEO of HubSpot, when they removed the calendar view from the mobile app. Yamini personally acknowledged that core features should not be removed mid-contract. At the time, I appreciated the transparency and took it as a sign that HubSpot was committed to doing right by customers.  Now it feels like d√©j√† vu ‚Äî only worse. Not only were core features removed, but we‚Äôre essentially being asked to pay more to get back the same functionality we had under contract. That feels like a bait-and-switch, which, under Massachusetts General Law Chapter 93A, could be considered a deceptive business practice.  Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs especially unfair:How can two parties sign a contract, agree to terms, and then only one side ‚Äî the vendor ‚Äî gets to change those terms, specifically to make more money? If we tried to do the same to our clients, we‚Äôd be sued.  I get that SaaS companies need to evolve. But downgrading our access mid-term, then upselling it back to us, undermines trust and feels deeply one-sided.  To be clear:    We‚Äôre not against product updates.    We‚Äôre not asking for anything extra.    We just want the tools we signed up for ‚Äî and that we were assured wouldn‚Äôt be taken away during the term of our agreement.    We‚Äôve asked for the following by tomorrow:    Restore our 4 Sales seats (we had 5 before).    Reinstate our deleted group scheduling link.    Avoid future mid-contract removals of core functionality.    Has anyone else experienced something like this with HubSpot (or another SaaS provider)?Is this something that could justify legal action, or are we being overly sensitive?  Any insights ‚Äî or similar experiences ‚Äî would really help us figure out our next steps.  Thanks in advance,Phil GanzPresident, Next Wave Mortgageüìû 617-529-9317üìß philipdganz@gmail.com"}

Most early-stage founders hit a wall because:  1. They chase ‚Äúgrowth hacks‚Äù instead of sustainable channelsThat means spending hours posting on Hacker News, trying cold DMs, or launching giveaways without a plan to repeat and scale what works.**If your lead source can‚Äôt be repeated every week with predictable output, it‚Äôs a gimmick, not a channel.  What to do instead:Pick one scalable channel that fits your audience (email, SEO, LinkedIn, paid search) and go deep.Example: If you're B2B, create one killer lead magnet, build a simple email sequence, and drive LinkedIn traffic to it with posts + comments. Run that loop until it prints leads consistently. Once it's working at small scale, then you optimize or automate it.  2. They confuse traffic with leadsGetting 5,000 visits from Product Hunt sounds great‚Ä¶ but if no one converts, it‚Äôs just noise.**Traffic is vanity. Leads are action-takers. If your homepage doesn‚Äôt have a clear call-to-action (CTA), you‚Äôre leaking potential every single day.  What to do instead:Design every page like it has one job... get the visitor to take the next step.If you‚Äôre B2B, that‚Äôs usually: ‚ÄúBook a call,‚Äù ‚ÄúGet the free audit,‚Äù or ‚ÄúDownload the guide.‚ÄùMake that CTA impossible to miss, repeat it mid-page and at the end, and test one offer at a time.Bonus tip: Use heatmaps (like Hotjar) to see if people are even scrolling or clicking. You‚Äôll be shocked how often they‚Äôre not.  3. They have a good product but a weak value propYour app might be brilliant but if your headline says ‚Äúthe all-in-one platform for synergy and success,‚Äù no one knows what you do.**Ask yourself: can a stranger read your website and instantly know who it‚Äôs for, what it does, and why it matters?  What to do instead:Write your homepage headline like it‚Äôs a billboard on the highway: clear, fast, and benefit-first.  Formula: [Who it‚Äôs for] + [What it helps them do] + [Why it‚Äôs better]  Example: ‚ÄúFor independent insurance agents who need more leads but are tired of buying junk leads, an AI-powered platform that writes your emails, follows up, and books appointments while you sleep.‚Äù Then back it up with bulletproof social proof and a single CTA.  4. Their offer isn‚Äôt clear, urgent, or uniqueIf your pitch could be copied and pasted onto your competitor‚Äôs homepage, you don‚Äôt have a real offer.**What do I get, how fast, why now, and what makes it different? That‚Äôs what your audience wants to know in the first 10 seconds.  What to do instead:Build your offer like you‚Äôre on Shark Tank; tight, outcome-driven, and built for speed.Ask:    What exactly am I delivering?    How fast will they see results?    Why is this better than doing nothing or hiring someone else?    What proof backs it up?    Example weak offer: ‚ÄúWe help businesses grow online.‚Äù  Example strong offer: ‚ÄúWe help local service businesses get 15+ booked calls/month in 30 days without spending a dime on ads.‚Äù  The stronger your offer, the less selling you have to do.  5. They‚Äôre afraid to niche, so they stay invisibleTrying to ‚Äúserve everyone‚Äù = no one remembers you. You‚Äôre not being flexible, you‚Äôre being forgettable.**The fastest-growing startups I‚Äôve worked with picked a very specific customer, solved one problem like a scalpel, and expanded later.  What to do instead:Pick a narrow market where the pain is visible, the money is real, and the buying cycle is short.Niche doesn‚Äôt mean small, it means specific.  Example:Instead of ‚Äúmarketing automation for small businesses,‚Äù say: ‚ÄúAI-powered follow-up funnels for SaaS start-ups who hate doing manual outreach.‚Äù  Once you win a niche, you earn the right to broaden. But until then, go deep, not wide, and become the obvious choice in a small pond.  If you‚Äôre under $20K MRR and can‚Äôt seem to grow, what‚Äôs the biggest bottleneck you‚Äôre running into right now? What‚Äôs working and what‚Äôs not for you."}

I'm not here to scare you away from building something great. Some of my clients have built amazing, profitable businesses. But if you're thinking this is a quick path to passive income, you need to know what you're really signing up for.  Here's what actually happens:  The good: I've worked with founders who went from idea to $50k MRR in their first year. One client built a simple scheduling tool for dentists and now makes more than his old corporate salary. Another created an AI agent for real estate and has a waiting list of customers.  The reality: For every success story, I work with 3-4 founders who struggle. Not because their ideas are bad, but because they underestimated everything that comes after I hand over the finished product.  Month 1-3: You've just paid me to build your MVP. It works, it's beautiful, and you're excited. You launch and... now what? You realize building was the easy part. Now you need to find customers, handle support, and figure out marketing. Nobody taught you how to do sales calls or write marketing copy.  Month 4-6: The honeymoon phase ends. Customer support emails pile up and you're learning to troubleshoot user problems. You're doing sales calls during lunch breaks from your day job. Your initial excitement gets replaced by the daily grind of actually running a business.  The challenges nobody mentions:  You're not a natural marketer. You had a great idea and hired someone to build it, but now you need to convince strangers to pay for it. Writing sales emails, running ads, getting on sales calls - it's a completely different skillset.  Cashflow is unpredictable. One month you get $2k in revenue, the next month people cancel and you're back to $500. You're trying to figure out if you should hire help or keep bootstrapping.  You become everything. CEO, salesperson, customer service, marketing manager - all while probably keeping your day job. It's exhausting and you'll feel like you're bad at most of it.  Decision paralysis. Should you add more features? Focus on marketing? Raise prices? Lower prices? You're making business decisions without a business background.  What the successful founders do:  They treat it like a real business from day one. They set up proper accounting, track metrics, and make data-driven decisions instead of guessing.  They validate before they hire me. The best clients come to me with pre-orders or at least a list of people begging for the solution.  They stay financially stable. They keep their day jobs until the business actually replaces their income, not just covers expenses.  They focus obsessively. Instead of asking me to add 10 features, they perfect their sales process and customer onboarding first.  My honest take:  Building a SaaS or AI agent can be incredibly rewarding. I've seen clients gain financial freedom, build something they're proud of, and solve real problems for people.  But it's not passive income. After I deliver your product, the real work begins. You need to become a marketer, salesperson, and business operator - often while keeping your day job.  If you're okay with that learning curve and genuinely excited about solving a problem (not just making money), it can be amazing.  I love what I do because I get to help founders bring their ideas to life. Some fail, some succeed, but the ones who go in understanding that the technical build is just the beginning have the best shot.  If you're thinking about this journey, feel free to reach out. I'm happy to give you an honest assessment of your idea and what it might take to make it work.  Just remember: getting the product built is the easy part. Everything that comes after is where most people struggle."}

I know what it's like to try to market a product that no one wants, I‚Äôve built two that completely failed. No one wanted them and I wasted months trying to make it work.  I‚Äôve also built successful products and the key difference was that the successful products solved a real problem. It sounds obvious but it‚Äôs easy to forget sometimes.  The hard part is how you validate that you are solving a real problem so I thought I‚Äôd share exactly how I did it:  Step one: Start with a problem thesis and talk to users    I was a founder and I had a problem that I suspected other founders had too    So I had my problem thesis and the next step was to talk to my would-be users to see if the problem was real and to understand their view of it better    I made a post on¬†r/SaaS¬†and¬†r/indiehackers¬†asking founders to answer a few questions and in return I would give them feedback on whatever they were building    The key part here was offering them something in return for their time. That makes it a lot easier to get answers    Here's one of the posts if you‚Äôre curious:¬†https://www.reddit.com/r/indiehackers/comments/1ea1cpd/lets_exchange_feedback/      The got me in touch with 8-10 founders who were willing to answer my survey.    I asked questions about pain points related to the problem and tried to get an idea if they were willing to adopt the solution I had in mind.    The responses were positive so I had the green light to start building a simple first version    Step two: Building the MVP    This is the easy part. Who doesn‚Äôt love building?    The critical thing here was that I tried to understand what the survey responses were telling me and built a bare bones solution addressing the pain points of these people    I built fast. Around 30 days for the MVP    That's it. It was time to market this MVP and see if I can get some users    Step three: Marketing and collecting feedback    First I set a clear goal. It wasn‚Äôt about getting customers, I just wanted as much feedback as possible so I would need active users. Understanding how to make the product better is so much more valuable at this point    I set the goal of getting 20 active users in two weeks    Then I asked myself where my users hang out and the answer was X and Reddit    Next step was to set daily volume targets. I decided to do 5 posts and 50 replies on X every day and on Reddit I would just write a new post when I had something that had worked well on X    So I knew exactly what to do every day and then I just executed that plan. It was easy, because I just had to take action, no questions asked    Two weeks later I had hit 100 users    That was the validation process I used. From there on, all I had to do was improve the product based on what users were telling me and continue marketing. That has taken me all the way to $7,300/mo and growth just becomes easier with time.  I hope my journey can inspire some of you to not give up and to follow a solid process for building your product.  Feel free to ask if you have any questions.  The project is Buildpad."}

The tool I made is called Tydal and it‚Äôs a simple tool to help founders market their product on Reddit without being spammy.  It‚Äôs my 6th project since starting this SAAS/software thing 1.5 years ago. For 1 year I‚Äôve showed up daily on Reddit, building side projects whenever I have free time, and never made any money. But a voice in my head kept telling me ‚Äúone day it will happen‚Äù.  Once I had completed what I had defined as MVP, I started cold Dming others and leaving a link to it in comments here and there. Not really thinking much of it.  Then the other night I was relaxing on the couch, watching tv, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone from stripe: ‚ÄúYour First Sale!‚Äù. Damn I was so excited. Unreal feeling. I also got a nice boost from an early feedback user who I gave a special LTD deal of $49 because he gave me early feedback. The rest were $19 subscriptions.  Not life changing money, but it‚Äôs the most motivating thing that‚Äôs happened to me in a long time. If you‚Äôre grinding on something, please just keep going, that first sale is out there  If you want to see what I made, here it is:¬†https://www.tydal.co/"}

It definitely wasn‚Äôt a straight line.  I tested tons of channels, scrapped things that didn‚Äôt work, and wanted to share a breakdown of the journey.  What worked:    Building in public on X (Twitter)I shared the process from scratch: feature updates, small wins, even bugs. It helped build trust and also gave visibility to the right crowd. No big following needed, just consistency and transparency.    Time-limited launch offersI started with a lower \"launch\" price while the product was still missing many features. Looking back, I‚Äôm surprised people bought it since it was very light. Lesson: Don‚Äôt wait to be ‚Äúready.‚Äù Price low, test the water, build trust.    Limited quantity deals (and still running one)I experimented with ‚ÄúOnly 50 lifetime licenses‚Äù and similar formats. That worked well to push early users to take the plunge without overthinking.    Word of mouth (surprising win!)Honestly, I didn‚Äôt expect it. But people loved the tool and started recommending it. Around 20% of my revenue came just from user referrals.    What didn't work    LinkedIn postsI was super consistent (3x/week), and some posts hit 10K+ impressions. But... 0 conversions. Might work better in B2B mid-market, but not for small businesses from what I saw. Or I didn't reach the right audience.    Email outreach (big burn)Sent over 2,000 cold emails. Got about 50 replies, 2-3 paying users... And no sales. Not worth the time/energy at this stage.    LinkedIn and Twitter cold DMsTried reaching out to potential users one by one. No results.    Affiliate marketingI thought signing my first users would make it easier to bring in affiliates. But activating affiliates is a job on its own. And actually, none got interested in actively promoting the product at this stage.    Next steps:  The experiment is still on.  SEO is what I‚Äôm now betting on mid/long term.  I‚Äôve seen great results from my SEO blogging strategy in past projects. So I‚Äôm using my own tool (of course right) to publish daily blogs, and I‚Äôm working on adding a smart backlink exchange feature to it grow authority.  Also will try paid ads and youtube videos soon, will report!  Best of luck builders!"}

Here‚Äôs what I realized: visibility without engagement is just a short-term win.  So I made one small change.I started sending a short, human-written email after launch with:  - A personal thank you  - How many people viewed their product  - A nudge to come back and upvote others  - An invite to reply if they had questions or feedback  That‚Äôs it.

At work, I used a Mac and fell in love with Raycast ‚Äî but at home I used Windows, and switching back without a good launcher drove me nuts.  I searched almost every available launcher for Windows or cross-platform, hoping for something as smooth and powerful as Raycast. To my surprise, nothing quite matched what I wanted. So I decided to build my own. (This was also my first time trying Tauri ‚Äî which helped me make it super lightweight and fast.)  I call it Sofast(which chinese name is \"Â¶ÇÂø´\"). My goal is to make it familiar yet different from Raycast in a few key ways:  ‚úÖ Focus on workflows, not plugins ‚Äî Plugins are great but often cause maintenance headaches, inconsistent UX, and are hard for non-developers. I aim for a simple Alfred-style workflow system that works for everyone, not just devs.  ‚úÖ Minimal hierarchy ‚Äî Multi-level menus can be annoying. Right now Sofast still has some, but I‚Äôm working on a ‚ÄúDIY panel‚Äù feature so you can show multiple search lists side by side, reducing the need to drill down.  ‚úÖ Mouse-friendly ‚Äî Raycast is keyboard-centric. But a lot of people rely on the mouse too ‚Äî so Sofast will work well whether you‚Äôre a keyboard ninja or prefer clicking.  I‚Äôm also experimenting with small touches to make daily use smoother. For example, when you choose a link, Sofast can automatically suggest a ‚Äújump link‚Äù command for you. There‚Äôs also an onboarding flow for new quicklinks, auto-fetching titles, and even a public quicklinks hub.  ‚ö°Ô∏è One note: Right now the app was originally built in Chinese ‚Äî I just added i18n support, so some corners might not be fully translated yet. If you spot missing translations, please let me know ‚Äî I‚Äôll fix them step by step.  If you have any ideas, suggestions, or thoughts about what a Raycast-like launcher should be on Windows (or cross-platform), I‚Äôd love to hear them!  Cheers!"}

The problem: Solo travelers, people living alone, or anyone in risky situations want peace of mind that someone will know if something happens to them.  How it works:    Set your trusted contact and check-in interval (24h, 7d, or 28d)    Write your emergency message (encrypted and secure)    We email you reminders - click \"I'm safe\" to reset the timer    If you don't respond to escalating warnings, your contact gets notified    Key features:    Escalating reminders prevent false alarms    Messages encrypted at rest - never accessed by us    Simple browser-based setup, works as PWA    1-month free trial, then subscription    I kept it intentionally simple - no complex features, just solves one specific problem well. The escalating system ensures your family doesn't panic over a missed email, but someone knows if you're actually in trouble.

I used no-code to build a first version  Before that, I would focus on perfect and clean code, popular tools, scalable infra.  I used free no-code because it has forms.  I asked existing paying customers  What are the main problems ? How did they solve before ? How much did they pay before ? Based on what they tell me, I did understand main problems:  ‚Ä¢ people don't have time on marketing  ‚Ä¢ people don't love marketing as much as building  ‚Ä¢ people want outcomes not hours spent  ‚Ä¢ people want systems not talks  So, I started doing step by step. It was ugly. My first sales calls were boring and not selling at all. I started doing research before the meeting, I started sending documents after the meeting what I can do for them and how can I help. I started doing follow up emails.  I use AI but not in everything  I love AI. But I don't use them in every task. For example, I use AI to make a research, to find information, competitors, to analyze niche, ICP. But I never use it for creating content.  My last advice  Don't afraid of shipping and building. Just do more, be patience. Learn new skills, talk to new people, and see new fields and trends."}

I wanted to share the story behind my app in case it resonates with anyone or if you have advice for someone trying to get their first real users. I don't want to violate any promotion rules there might be on this subreddit especially since I just lurk with this account and never post, so I won't say the name of it unless I'm asked.  The idea came from my girlfriend. She was constantly asking me to remind her to reach out to people or follow up on something, and I said, ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt there something out there that could remind you already?‚Äù Her answer stuck with me: everything she tried was too complicated or scattered. Nothing had everything in one place and felt simple. The reminder app on her phone wouldn't keep track of people with notes, all of the reminders just disappear after she is reminded.  So I built something for her, just as a hobby project. I had only ever worked on group projects for school, never anything of my own. But I figured it was a chance to learn, use my skills, and help someone I care about. I mean that's what I went to school for right?  The app helps people stay connected with others by sending reminders to reach out, tracking past interactions, and keeping things like notes, events, and contact info in one place. I made it lightweight and easy to use. There isn't fancy UI or anything, I didn't have much background in html or css, so I just watched youtube and asked chatgpt to fix my errors.  In order to give it to my girlfriend and some friends I had to buy a domain so I could put my app online for their convenience. I had recently taken a database class so I used supabase and learned about row-level security and authentication so I could keep the information secure. Since the domain cost me a little money, I figured why not try implementing Stripe and see if anyone would pay for it? Maybe I could recoup some money.  That‚Äôs when I realized I‚Äôve learned how to build, but I‚Äôve never learned how to market. I launched on Product Hunt and it flopped. I have 0 paying users and no real traffic. The only people using the app are friends, and I feel like they‚Äôre being nice, not necessarily honest, because they know me. I underestimated what it would take to start getting users and advertising for the first time. Now that I just put my work out there it feels like a monumental task to start coming up with ideas for advertising and paying to get people to notice what I've done.  So I haven‚Äôt really done any advertising or real outreach yet and I‚Äôm not sure where to start. I can‚Äôt afford to run ads as a broke college student. I‚Äôd love to get this in front of people who don't know me and see if it actually solves a problem for them. I know it might not be the most original idea, but it was a start for me, and I know that a lot of SaaS out there that are successful aren't actually that flashy. But maybe that's just feeding my delusion that this will get successful out of nowhere.  Anyway, that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Just trying to validate the idea with real users.

It‚Äôs a small step, but it means a lot.  Getting here wasn‚Äôt smooth.  We‚Äôre based in a country where Stripe isn‚Äôt supported, so just accepting payments meant figuring out how to register a company abroad, going through third-party services, and waiting weeks just to get the infrastructure in place.  I also tried sharing our product on Reddit, Twitter, and other platforms early on. At times, it felt like shouting into the void. No signups. No responses. But I kept showing up, refining the product, learning from what didn‚Äôt work, and listening to the few people who did give feedback.  And now, finally, one person saw value in what we‚Äôre building and paid for it.  It‚Äôs not about the amount. It‚Äôs about validation, momentum, and proof that we‚Äôre moving in the right direction.

We started testing in January with¬†zero¬†knowledge and just wrapped up May with 45,000 emails sent, averaging ~3% reply rate and 25-30% close rate on replies.  It‚Äôs now a key driver of our growth, so I wanted to share what I learned ‚Äì especially for anyone starting out. If I can do it, you absolutely can too. Here's the full breakdown: Part 1: Technical Setup & Warmup Separate Domains = Safety First    Never use your main domain for cold emails    Register 2-5 domains similar to your main one    Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC immediately    Email Setup    Use Google Workspace or Outlook ‚Äì more trustworthy than random hosts    Create 2-3 accounts per domain    Start with 10 emails/day/account and ramp up slowly over 2-3 weeks    Max out at ~25 emails/account/day    Warming Up Tips    Warm accounts for at least 2 weeks using warmup tools or manual sending    Use real-looking names + profile pictures    Forward outreach domains to your main site    Add custom tracking domain (e.g.,¬†track.yoursite.com)   Part 2: Finding Leads That Actually Care For White-Collar/Tech Niches    Apollo.io¬†(best overall)    Sales Navigator + enrichment tool (like Clay or Wiza)    Crunchbase or PitchBook for funding info    For Local Businesses    Outscraper or Clay‚Äôs Maps feature    Use filters like review count or website presence    If You Know Your Ideal Customer Type    Try Ocean or Pandamatch to find lookalikes   Part 3: Clean Your List (Seriously) Bad Emails = Bad Results    You‚Äôll hurt your deliverability and waste sending slots    Use tools like:    MillionVerifier (cheap & effective)    ListKit or Listmint (for trickier addresses)    VerifyEmailAI (underrated gem)     Part 4: Segment Like a Pro Doing Deep Research on each lead automatically segments the messaging, and with AI it does it automatically.  We built¬†https://tryhumen.com¬†to automatically enrich leads with Deep Research and therefore Hyper-personalize each email. Would be happy to discuss more if you DM me.  Mass-blasting generic messages doesn‚Äôt work anymore.  Segment by:    Industry    Job title (decision-maker vs influencer)    Geography    Tech stack    Challenges you solve    Upcoming events (conferences, seasons, etc.)   Part 5: Writing Emails That Get Replies For this part, our proprietary software (we offer it as a SaaS too), automatically generated highly bespoke emails based on Deep Research, but we also have the option of creating email templates, and tell the AI Agent to add custom personalization at certain sections.  Golden Rule: Keep It Human    Plain text only    No images, fancy HTML, or links in the signature    Personalized intros and simple sign-offs    Use spintax for variation    4-Part Structure    Personalized Hook‚ÄúHi Tom, noticed you just hired a RevOps lead ‚Äì congrats!‚Äù    Problem & Solution‚ÄúWe help SaaS teams reduce churn with automated onboarding triggers.‚Äù    Clear CTA‚ÄúOpen to a quick 10-min chat this week to see if it‚Äôs a fit?‚Äù    Social Proof / Objection Killer‚ÄúWe helped [Company] drop churn by 30% in 60 days.‚Äù    Subject Line Tips    Short + curious wins:    ‚ÄúQuick question, {{first_name}}‚Äù    ‚ÄúSaw this at {{company}}‚Äù    ‚Äú{{first_name}}, worth a quick chat?‚Äù     Part 6: Follow-Up Like a Human Don't overthink it. Just follow up.    2‚Äì4 follow-ups max    Space them naturally (2‚Äì7 days apart)    Each follow-up should reframe the offer or add new info    Keep them short and polite   Part 7: Testing & Scaling Before Scaling:    Run templates through¬†mail-tester.com    Send test batches of 50‚Äì100    Track:    Reply Rate (3‚Äì5% is solid)    Positive Reply Rate (1‚Äì2%)    Booking Rate (0.5‚Äì1%)    Close Rate (20‚Äì30% of booked calls)      Scaling Tip:    Add new accounts gradually    Monitor inboxes daily    Don‚Äôt get lazy with list hygiene or personalization   Beginner Checklist   Buy 2-3 extra domains    Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC    Warm up 2‚Äì3 accounts per domain    Get leads from Apollo, Maps, or LinkedIn    Verify every single email    Segment based on job role, industry, and pain points    Write plain-text, human-sounding emails    Send small test batches before scaling    Track results & iterate    It‚Äôs been a game changer for us, and I genuinely wish I started earlier. Start small, tweak as you go, and¬†don‚Äôt let perfection slow you down.  Hope this helps someone! Feel free to drop questions or thoughts. And if you'd like to use our SaaS for the Deep Research and Email generation at scale, feel free to link via DM :)"}

Every site feels vague or pushy, and no one really explains how numbers are calculated.  So I spent months gathering public data  verdict databases, payout benchmarks, ROI from lawyers, injury severity scales and built a calculator that gives you a real, data backed estimate.  Right now, it‚Äôs free to use and does two things:    Gives you a detailed estimate based on your info    Lets you opt in to connect with a lawyer if you want help or a second opinion    It does collect emails, mostly so people can save their results or talk to someone directly but I tried to keep it simple and not spammy.

The answer will always depend on the problem you solve, what your solution looks like, and who your target audience is.  But it does help to get insight into how others got their first users. You can learn from it, be inspired, and use a few of the same tricks yourself.  Since my SaaS is now at $5.8k MRR, it could be valuable for me to share exactly how I got my first paying customers.  I‚Äôll try to be as detailed as possible to make it more helpful:  To begin with, I got my first users by posting in communities where my target audience was on¬†X¬†(Build in Public community) and¬†Reddit¬†(r/SaaS,¬†r/indiehackers).  I would aim for around 2 posts and 30 replies every day on X. Replies are easy, just react to what people say and add value/your opinion. No need to overcomplicate it.  On Reddit I would post about every 2-3 days.  If you don‚Äôt know what to post about, here‚Äôs what I did:    Share your journey building/growing your project daily (today I did this, led to x results, etc.)    Share valuable lessons related to your target audience/project (if you don‚Äôt have your own lessons yet, do research on the topic or share lessons from well known people)    Sometimes simply share your honest thoughts without overthinking it too much    Here are some of my posts as examples for you (pic)  Once the first users started coming through the door, they sent feedback through email and a simple feedback button on the dashboard. I used the feedback to implement features and improvements people wanted.  After 1.5 months of improving product and daily social media posting and engaging, I launched on Product Hunt.  The Product Hunt launch went very well and my product ended up featured at #4 with 500+ upvotes.  Tips for launching on Product Hunt: To attract attention and get upvotes, I posted about the launch in communities I was active in.  I took massive action on launch day: 13 posts, 91 replies, and 22 DMs.    The posts were launch updates, sharing stats, and sharing the marketing efforts.    Replies were just normal engagement, no ‚Äúpls upvote my launch‚Äù    DMs were directly asking people for their support    Being active in communities is the easiest way for a small founder to get support and early upvotes for a launch.  The first few upvotes are all you need to stand out in the beginning. The rest is pretty much organic votes from Product Hunt visitors.  A few hours into the launch I got my¬†first paying customer, and after 24 hours I had¬†five!  This path to getting my first paying customers is really quite¬†straightforward:    I posted about my journey building and growing the product    Shared lessons and behind-the-scenes stats of what worked    Posted about topics relevant to my target audience and product    Launched on Product Hunt after I got initial traction and validation    Sharing your journey is powerful. People simply like following the stories of others who are¬†similar¬†to them.  (My SaaS and $5.8k MRR Stripe)"}

I make $250/month with my product, and although it may not seem like a lot, I'm happy with it!  A couple of weeks ago, I officially launched WaitlistNow. It‚Äôs a no-code waitlist creation tool to help founders validate their product ideas before building and automates the whole process. It was my 5th project after 4 previous flops and I was hoping to receive a different outcome with this one.  So after I launched I:  - Sent an email to existing people on the waitlist- Posted on twitter, bluesky, peerlist, etc.- Posted on reddit  And the rest is history (maybe small for others but big for me)  On the first day after launching, I got 2 sales, and just a few days later, I received my 3rd sale before soon after receiving my 4th and 5th sales.  One thing that worked for me was I partnered with an affiliate and they were able to boost my sales for a bit, and I got consistent revenue for about 3 days.  One of the users even reached out to me, complimenting me on what I had built and how it was a great idea, which meant the world to me. They also gave me a bunch of great feedback. It meant that what I have built is leaving some impact on others.  I am happy beyond words :)  I am even happier as people are loving the product that I made. I have received so much good feedback, and it makes me even happier that people are actually engaging with the product and making waitlists, and validating their ideas.  I hope this brings smiles to all reading this post :) and inspires a few of you.  I know everyone around me is making 1000's of dollars a month but I am really okay with where I am right now and I think everyone else who just started should be as well.

The concept is simple:A Tinder-style job platform where candidates upload a clean resume, and recruiters swipe right/left based purely on that. No long application forms, no ATS black holes. Just fast, intent-based matching.  Most of you would be wondering why would anyone want to shift to this platform or why should they even rely on this in the first place, even I thought of it as a job seeker but here's something I realized which will make your application stand out from the other platforms.    No algorithmic noise ‚Äî every swipe is a real recruiter seeing your actual profile.    One profile, one resume, one tap to connect ‚Äî no multiple-page forms or irrelevant questions.    Filtered, relevant exposure ‚Äî you're only shown to recruiters hiring for your skillset and role preference.    Instant feedback ‚Äî if a recruiter is interested, you get notified right away and can chat instantly.    In short, your resume gets seen by the right people, faster, and with real intent.This cuts down the waiting, guessing, and ghosting that we‚Äôve all dealt with on LinkedIn or Naukri.  I‚Äôm currently building the MVP and would really appreciate your thoughts:    As a job seeker, would you use something like this?    As a recruiter, would this make early-stage hiring easier or faster?    What would you want to see (or avoid) in a platform like this?    Happy to take feedback, even brutally honest ones. Appreciate your time!"}

Since then, I‚Äôve gone through the typical indie hacker rollercoaster ‚Äî months of building in silence, trying every marketing method I could find, and getting almost no response.  It‚Äôs tough when you put time and energy into something you believe in, only to launch it and hear‚Ä¶ nothing.  But recently, I built something that did take off. BigIdeasDB now has over 3,000 signups and brings in $3,600/month in MRR.  The difference between my failed attempts and this success?Real demand.  When you‚Äôre solving a real, painful problem, everything feels different. Marketing becomes easier. Feedback becomes clearer. The product grows faster ‚Äî not because it‚Äôs effortless, but because it matters to the people you‚Äôre building for.  If you‚Äôre still early in your journey, here‚Äôs the exact process I followed to find that demand and build BigIdeasDB:  1. Find a problem you‚Äôd pay to fix  For me, that problem was clear:Founders were building SaaS ideas without knowing what problem to solve.  I had done it myself ‚Äî spent weeks or months on an idea, only to find out no one actually needed it. I wanted a better way to find proven, validated problems that had demand behind them.  2. Create a simple solution concept  Once I had that problem nailed down, the solution came naturally:A platform that collects validated pain points from Reddit, G2, and Upwork, pairs them with actionable SaaS ideas, and helps founders skip the guesswork.  I didn‚Äôt start by building the full product ‚Äî I mapped out what it would do, how it would help, and how users would benefit from it.  3. Validate the idea with real people  Before writing code, I talked to other founders in communities I was part of ‚Äî Discord, Reddit, Twitter DMs. I asked them:    How do you currently find product ideas?    Do you ever struggle to validate whether a problem is real?    Would you use a tool like this?    Would you pay for it if it saved you time or helped you find a winning idea?    The feedback was consistent:Yes, this was a pain. Yes, people wanted a better way to find problems. That gave me the confidence to build the MVP.  4. Ship the MVP  I spent 30 days building the first version of BigIdeasDB. It was bare-bones but focused:    A database full of thousands of problems scraped and analyzed from Reddit, G2, and Upwork so that users know what people are willing to use    Paired solution ideas    A basic UI to browse and search through them    From there, I shared it with the same people I talked to earlier, posted in communities, and got early users onboard.  5. Keep marketing, keep improving  The goal was never ‚Äúgo viral.‚Äù My goal was just to get real users who‚Äôd give me feedback.  I committed to showing up daily:    Tweeting and replying consistently    Posting on Reddit when I had something valuable to share    Taking every piece of feedback seriously and improving the product weekly    The result?3,000+ signups and $3,600 in MRR ‚Äî and it‚Äôs still growing.  I hope this helps someone early in their journey. It took me 8+ failed projects to really understand that demand > everything.  If you‚Äôre curious, the product is¬†https://bigideasdb.com.

You're trying to present, answer complex questions on the fly, remember all the details you prepped, and close the deal ‚Äì often without a dedicated sales team or years of experience. It's easy to get flustered, forget key points, or give less-than-perfect answers that cost you a lead.  Our Idea:¬†Imagine an AI sales co-pilot. Before your call, you feed it everything: client background, your offering's unique selling points, potential objections, desired outcomes. Then, during the live call, this AI listens to your customer's questions¬†in real-time¬†and instantly suggests the most relevant, persuasive, and accurate responses directly to you.  The Benefit:¬†Never be caught off-guard again. Sound like a seasoned expert, instantly recall specific details, handle objections smoothly, and boost your confidence on every single call. The goal is simple: help you close more leads, faster.  Who is this for?¬†Sole founders, early-stage startups, freelancers, and young entrepreneurs who need to nail their sales conversations but don't have a large sales team or budget for extensive training.  Reddit, we need your input:    Is this a real pain point for you or your business?    Would a tool like this be a game-changer for your sales calls?    What features would be absolutely essential?

The ones who don‚Äôt make it through fail because they miss the following from their pitch/deck.  If you‚Äôre building something and planning to raise, following this exact structure will dramatically increase your odds of raising money:  Slide 1: Team  This is¬†the¬†most important slide. Investors bet on people. Highlight relevant experience, technical expertise, and why you‚Äôre the best people to build this startup. For example, if you‚Äôre building a fintech startup and have a background in finance or banking, say that. You want to show why you‚Äôre the right people to be building this.  Slide 2: Problem  Don‚Äôt just say what your product does explain the¬†pain. Why is this problem painful enough that people will pay to solve it? Keep this slide simple and easy to understand.  Slide 3: Why Now?  Timing matters. Has there been a shift in consumer behaviour, tech (e.g., AI), or regulation that makes this the right time to build?  Slide 4: Solution  Keep it simple. What do you do, and how does it solve the problem better than what exists?  Slide 5: Market Size  Please no vague ‚Äú$100B TAM‚Äù slides. Show realistic market sizing:‚Üí Number of potential customers √ó your pricing.Example: If you‚Äôre selling a ¬£2,000/year SaaS tool to UK dental clinics, estimate the number of clinics and do the maths.It should ideally point to a billion-pound opportunity (eventually), but grounded in real logic.  Slide 6: Business Model  How do you make money? Subscriptions, commissions, SaaS, marketplaces¬† keep it straightforward.  Slide 7: Competition  This slide isn‚Äôt about showing you‚Äôre ‚Äúthe only one.‚Äù Show you know the landscape and how you‚Äôre different or better. A simple matrix or quadrant helps.  Slide 8: Traction  everything you‚Äôve done so far and any relevant revenue, user numbers, etc. You can‚Äôt raise with just an idea. Pilot customers, waitlists, revenue, usage metrics ‚Äî anything that proves demand. You usually can‚Äôt raise with just an idea.  Slide 9: The Ask  How much are you raising, and what‚Äôs the plan for it?  Example: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre raising ¬£300K to hit ¬£1M ARR in the next 12 months and expand the team from 3 to 8.‚Äù  Slide 10: Roadmap  Give investors visibility into your next 12‚Äì18 months. Milestones, launches, hiring, etc. Everything you hope to achieve before your next funding round.  Notes:    Keep everything short and to the point    Each slide should not have too much text or data. You should be able to infer at a glance.    Do not exceed 10-12 slides    Your goal is to convince the investor that your company could be worth hundreds of millions one day    If you guys need any feedback or challenges with your deck, leave a comment or DM.¬†I also have a pitch deck template I can share with you if you want"}

I‚Äôll try building one that feels valuable to you all and even share updates here if you‚Äôre curious. Thanks in advance!"}

Over the last two months, I‚Äôve demoed this to over 100 prospects (mostly founders and sales leaders) and wanted to share what‚Äôs resonating ‚Äî and what‚Äôs getting me booked calls at under $5 CAC.  Here‚Äôs what I learned:    The personalization bar has shifted. People can spot GPT emails instantly. You don‚Äôt stand out unless you actually research their company and current role ‚Äî this is where Humen shines. We use a custom agent (think: poor man‚Äôs Perplexity) that scours the web for recent news, achievements, and unique facts, then integrates everything into your cold emails automatically.    Most teams are duct-taping Apollo + Slack + HubSpot + Notion. Humen cuts that down to one tab: drag in a CSV, select your style, and get 30+ emails personalized and scheduled in minutes.    We‚Äôre 10√ó cheaper than anything out there. Because I built the stack myself (no offshoring, no reselling other APIs), we‚Äôre at $80/month for 1,000 leads researched and personalized. No upsell, no surprises, cancel anytime.    Who this is for:    Founders doing their own outbound    Lean SDR teams who want personalization at scale (not spray and pray)    Anyone tired of being locked into SaaS bloat    Want to test it with your own leads?I‚Äôll run a few for you, free. Drop a comment or DM me your CSV and I‚Äôll show you exactly what your outreach could look like ‚Äî no strings attached.  Ask me anything about AI, outbound, or building this solo."}

The tool I made is called WaitlistNow and it‚Äôs a simple no-code tool to help founders validate their SAAS ideas. It also has built in analytics for the user and automates the whole process of building a waitlist.  It‚Äôs my 5th project since starting this SAAS/software thing 1.2 years ago. For 1.2 years I‚Äôve showed up daily on Reddit, building side projects whenever I have free time, and never made any money. But a voice in my head kept telling me ‚Äúone day it will happen‚Äù.  Once I had completed what I had defined as MVP, I started cold Dming others and leaving a link to it in comments here and there. Not really thinking much of it.  Then the other night(a few weeks ago) I was relaxing on the couch, watching tv, when suddenly I get a notification on my phone from stripe: ‚ÄúYour First Sale!‚Äù. Damn I was so excited. Unreal feeling.  Not life changing money, but it‚Äôs the most motivating thing that‚Äôs happened to me in a long time. If you‚Äôre grinding on something, please just keep going, that first sale is out there.  After that sale, with the momentum I got, I was able to slowly scale to get up to 12 sales and a bunch of feedback. Although it may not seem like a lot to some people it‚Äôs amazing to me.

It started out simple as something I needed for myself.  Over the past few months, growth has been strong.  The product helps you write SEO-optimized blog posts and articles by analyzing what‚Äôs already going viral on Reddit.  It looks at trending and highly discussed posts across subreddits to uncover what people are genuinely interested in. By tapping into these topics, you can create content that is relevant, insightful, and proven to resonate with real audiences.  This means your blog posts are more likely to rank on Google and attract traffic because you're writing about things people are already eager to read and talk about.  I shared my progress on X in the Build in Public community and posted a few times on Reddit.  I also launched the tool on Product Hunt which brought in the first users.  54 days in I hit 400 usersAt day 98 I hit 850 usersToday the app has over 1,600 users  The original goal was 1,000 users by the end of the year but I hit that early.  I recently started testing paid ads to see if I can take growth to the next level.  If you are looking for a product idea that actually gets users, here is what worked for me:    Start by solving a problem you've experienced yourself.    Talk to others who are like you to make sure the problem is real and that people actually want a solution.    Build something simple first, then use feedback to make it better over time. A big reason this tool is working right now is because more people are trying to write blogs and grow with SEO.

For clinic staff, the administrative burden of tracking down patients who skip check-ins or medications is a daily struggle‚Äîone that eats up hours and impacts patient outcomes.  The Challenge in Healthcare:    Front-desk teams juggle endless calls to confirm appointments, check medication adherence, and gather post-visit feedback.    Manual follow-ups are time-consuming, often leading to overlooked high-risk cases and avoidable readmissions.    Studies show that automating routine follow-ups can reduce no-shows and improve patient compliance‚Äîbut clinics rarely have the bandwidth to implement it.    How LUNA‚Äôs AI Patient Follow-Up Helps:    Automates 80% of routine check-ins, freeing staff to focus on patients who need urgent attention.    Flags high-risk cases in real-time, ensuring timely human intervention.    Reduces burnout by handling repetitive tasks, so your team can prioritize meaningful patient interactions.    Thoughtful Takeaway: AI isn‚Äôt here to replace your staff‚Äîit‚Äôs here to handle the grunt work so they can do what they do best: provide compassionate care. How is your clinic managing post-visit follow-ups today?"}

Studies show that 62% of small business calls go unanswered, and 85% of those callers never try again. For law firms, this translates to missed opportunities and frustrated potential clients.  The Challenge: Receptionists at law firms juggle multiple tasks‚Äîanswering calls, scheduling consultations, and qualifying leads‚Äîoften leading to burnout and inefficiencies. Long hold times or unanswered calls can deter clients, especially when urgent legal matters are at stake.  The Solution: LUNA‚Äôs Legal Intake Assistant steps in to support receptionists by automating initial client interactions. It answers calls, qualifies leads, and schedules consultations‚Äîfreeing up human staff to focus on high-value tasks like client relationships and case management. This isn‚Äôt about replacing people; it‚Äôs about empowering them to work smarter.  The Takeaway: Imagine reducing call abandonment rates while giving your receptionists the breathing room they need. How could your firm benefit from a more streamlined intake process?"}

Lessons:    Solve real problems (e.g, save them time and effort, make them more money). Focus on the pain points of your target customers. Solve 1 problem and do it really well.    Prefer to use the tools that you already know. Don‚Äôt spend too much time thinking about what are the best tool to use. The best tool for you is the one you already know. Your customers won't care about the tools you used, what they care about is you're solving the problem that they have.    Start with the MVP. Don't get caught up in adding every feature you can think of. Start with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves the core problem, then iterate based on user feedback.    Know your customer. Deeply understand who your customer is and what they need. Tailor your messaging, product features, and support to meet those needs specifically.    Fail fast. Validate immediately to see if people will pay for it then move on if not. Don't over-engineer. It doesn't need to be scalable initially.    Be ready to pivot. If your initial idea isn't working, don't be afraid to pivot. Sometimes the market needs something different than what you originally envisioned.    Data-driven decisions. Use data to guide your decisions. Whether it's user behavior, market trends, or feedback, rely on data to inform your next steps.    Iterate quickly. Speed is your friend. The faster you can iterate on feedback and improve your product, the better you can stay ahead of the competition.    Do lots of marketing. This is a must! Build it and they will come rarely succeeds.    Keep on shipping üöÄ Many small bets instead of 1 big bet.    Playbook that what worked for me (will most likely work for you too)  The great thing about this playbook is it will work even if you don't have an audience (e.g, close to 0 followers, no newsletter subscribers etc...).  1. Problem  Can be any of these:    Scratch your own itch.    Find problems worth solving. Read negative reviews + hang out on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.    2. MVP  Set an appetite (e.g, 1 day or 1 week to build your MVP).  This will force you to only build the core and really necessary features. Focus on things that will really benefit your users.  3. Validation    Share your MVP on X, Reddit and Facebook groups.    Reply on posts complaining about your competitors, asking alternatives or recommendations.    Reply on posts where the author is encountering a problem that your product directly solves.    Do cold and warm DMs.    One of the best validation is when users pay for your MVP.  When your product is free, when users subscribe using their email addresses and/or they keep on coming back to use it.  4. SEO  ROI will take a while and this requires a lot of time and effort but this is still one of the most sustainable source of customers. 2 out of 3 of my projects are already benefiting from SEO. I'll start to do SEO on my latest project too.  That's it! Simple but not easy since it still requires a lot of effort but that's the reality when building a startup especially when you have no audience yet.  Leave a comment if you have a question, I'll be happy to answer it.  P.S. The SaaS that I built is a¬†tool that automates finding customers¬†from social media. Basically saves companies time and effort since it works 24/7 for them. Built it to scratch my own itch and surprisingly companies started paying for it when I launched the MVP and it now grew to hundreds of customers from different countries, most are startups."}

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned that most advice doesn‚Äôt tell you: 1. Simple is 10x harder than it sounds Cutting features hurts. But every extra button, setting, or ‚Äúmaybe later‚Äù idea adds weight that slows you down. What‚Äôs simple to use takes discipline to build. 2. Marketing > Code I spent weeks perfecting the backend, but crickets. One good Reddit thread or value-first post brought more users than a month of features. 3. Talking to real users isn‚Äôt optional Not just to ‚Äúvalidate‚Äù the idea, but to see how people describe their problem. Their words = your marketing copy. 4. Consistency beats hype I‚Äôve seen more growth from slow, boring consistency (posting, improving, following up) than from big launches or paid ads. 5. You don‚Äôt need to be a genius‚Äîyou need to not give up Most micro-SaaS projects don‚Äôt fail because the idea is bad. They fail because the builder burns out or gives up too soon.  Still early in my journey, but it‚Äôs already taught me more than any YouTube tutorial ever could.  If you're building something similar‚Äîor just trying to make something small but useful‚ÄîI'd love to hear what lessons you've learned too."}

I kept adding features, tweaking UI, overthinking the \"growth hacks\" but nothing moved the needle. Then I finally asked the people who didn‚Äôt convert:  ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat felt off?‚Äù  ‚ÄúWhat would make this actually useful?‚Äù  Brutal honesty followed.  \"Sketchy.\"  \"Too much going on.\"  \"I don‚Äôt get what it does.\"  At first it stung. Then it helped. I stripped it down, rewrote the copy, cut features, made it dead simple and actually started solving the real problem.  Fast forward: 7 months in, $20k in revenue, all from word-of-mouth and fixes based on user feedback.  No ads. No growth agency. Just‚Ä¶ listening. Rebuilding. Repeating.  If you‚Äôre stuck: stop marketing for a week. Start asking better questions.  It changed everything for me and it might for you as well."}

Some shipped, some didn‚Äôt. Most flopped. At one point, I had started working on what eventually became BigIdeasDB, a platform that helps founders find real, validated problems to build around. I had the idea, started scraping Reddit posts, Upwork listings, G2 reviews‚Ä¶ but I paused.  Back then, I had a habit of stopping halfway. I‚Äôd build something, lose confidence when it didn‚Äôt immediately take off, and jump to the next thing. That almost happened with this one too.  At the time, I had a working prototype. I could generate startup ideas from Reddit threads, analyze SaaS gaps from reviews, and turn freelance gigs into product ideas. I even shared a small post or two, got decent engagement, some messages, but nothing crazy.  I almost gave up again.  But something told me this time was different. So I kept going. I finished the MVP. I posted consistently. I asked for feedback. I improved it weekly based on what people actually wanted.  Now BigIdeasDB has over 3,000 users and has made $16,000 in revenue.  Looking back, I realize how many projects I gave up on just before they might have worked.  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm sharing this. If you‚Äôre building something, don‚Äôt stop halfway. Finish it. Talk to people. Share it. Iterate.  It probably won‚Äôt take off right away. But you‚Äôll never know if you quit too early."}

Here's the link to the project, if you are curios: website  The funny part, this project was built on no-code.  Why? Because before that I was focused on clean code, scalability, infra, tech stack and etc. But in reality, people do not care about it.  They need a simple product that solve their problem or save their time or make money to them.  Because of that I changed my whole concept. I just go to no-code, build something very fast in a few hours, connect it with domain. I just go to the ICP (ideal customer profile) and send them links. Ask them for a payment, a bunch of questions, get on the call.  If I see a validation something like money or comments (I need that). I just go do it very fast and lean.  I could never have imagined this one year ago when I was struggling hard with marketing and trying my best to get people to visit my websites. Now all of a sudden our project has turned into a full-time job!  Here are my stats:  Visitors: 1,880  Revenue: $4000 (of this project only)  Session time: 25s  I hope one day to see the same post from you.

Some said it wouldn‚Äôt work. A few gave it a shot anyway.  Now:    14,000 visits    576 users    374 products launched    $370 in revenue    It‚Äôs still early. Still small. But this is the first time a project I built solo has helped other bootstrapped founders, and made real money doing it. I‚Äôm not chasing huge growth.

Here's why this \"must-do\" startup milestone might actually hurt your business. The Product Hunt Reality Check It's not the traffic goldmine you think it is. Most PH launches generate 500-2000 visitors on launch day. Sounds great until you realize:    90% bounce within 30 seconds    Conversion rates are typically 0.1-0.5% (vs 2-5% from targeted channels)    Traffic dies completely after 48 hours    The audience mismatch is real. Product Hunt users are primarily:    Other founders hunting for inspiration    Investors looking for deal flow    Tech enthusiasts collecting digital products    Unless you're building developer tools or productivity apps for makers, your ICP probably isn't scrolling PH at 12:01 AM PST. The Hidden Costs Nobody Talks About Time opportunity cost: You can lose 80+ hours for a proper PH launch:    2 weeks building hunter relationships    Creating PH-specific assets (GIFs, graphics, copy)    Coordinating launch day promotion    Managing comments and engagement    That's 80 hours you could spend on actual customer development, content marketing, or product improvement.  The vanity metrics trap: A #3 Product of the Day badge looks impressive on your wall, but investors and customers care about MRR, retention, and product-market fit. PH success often masks real traction problems.  Preparation theater: The elaborate launch sequences, hunter outreach, and timing strategies feel productive but don't move the needle on revenue or customer acquisition.  The copycat risk: Launching publicly on PH essentially hands your competitors a detailed playbook. I've seen founders get \"Sherlock'd\" - someone builds a similar product, launches it 2 weeks later with better marketing, and steals mindshare. Your months of R&D become free market research for fast followers who can iterate on your positioning and messaging. What You Should Be Doing Instead Direct customer channels:    Cold outreach to target accounts    Industry-specific communities and forums    Content marketing in niche publications    Partnership with complementary tools   When Product Hunt DOES Make Sense   Developer tools or productivity apps    Consumer-facing products with broad appeal    You have a strong existing network to leverage    You're optimizing for press coverage over customers    Your target market overlaps with PH demographics   The Bottom Line Product Hunt can work, but it's not a magic bullet. The startup echo chamber makes it feel mandatory, but your customers probably don't care about your PH ranking.  Focus on channels where your actual customers spend time. Build real relationships with real users. Solve real problems.  The best marketing is often the most boring: talk to customers, iterate based on feedback, and grow sustainably.  What's your experience with Product Hunt? Did it move the needle for your business or just feed the vanity metrics machine?"}

Step 1: Build a laser-focused list  Target: Founders and decision-makers in fast-moving B2B niches  I would use gojiberry.ai to get the best lead list for my ICP.  100 leads, with high intent data.  Step 2: Sharpen the pitch  No long messages. No links. Just a fast trigger:  \"Our AI agent can spot 100+ high-intent leads ready to buy from you.  These leads are already:  ‚Äì Engaging with your competitors‚Äô content  ‚Äì Interacting with influencers in your niche  ‚Äì Posting online that they‚Äôre actively looking to buy  Let me show you how to find them, in just a few clicks.  Deal ?\"  Step 3: Go omnichannel  I don‚Äôt rely on cold email alone  I hit LinkedIn, phones, and email in parallel  ‚Äì First touch on LinkedIn (manual + voice note if needed)  ‚Äì Second on call (with enriched number from Lusha, Gojiberry, etc.)  ‚Äì Third via email (only if I haven‚Äôt gotten a response)  Goal: Reach 100‚Äì150 people before noon  Step 4: Convert fast  Morning is for outreach  Afternoon is for meetings and converting warm replies  The second someone replies, I try to hop on a quick call or voice message  If they‚Äôre a fit, I send a payment link or lightweight service doc on the spot  Make it easy to say yes today  Step 5: Lock the sale  If I sense hesitation, I ask directly:  ‚ÄúIs there anything holding you back from moving forward now?‚Äù  If needed, I offer a frictionless entry point:  ‚Äì Low-commitment trial  ‚Äì Quick start offer  ‚Äì Cancel anytime promise  Step 6: Nudge warm leads  Before the day ends, I send a voice message follow-up to anyone still on the fence  Sometimes all it takes is one personal push to close the gap  By the end of the day:  300 custom touches  20‚Äì30 convos  3‚Äì5 small deals  $500 MRR secured  You don‚Äôt need a funnel  You don‚Äôt need ads  You don‚Äôt even need a product if you‚Äôre solving a real problem  You just need clarity, speed, and a little courage to get in front of people who already feel the pain  Now your turn.

Some of them got a few users, but they never made money. I kept running into the same issue: I was building without knowing if people actually wanted what I was making.  My latest project is different :)  I launched BigIdeasDB just a few months ago, and it made $15,800 in revenue within that time ‚Äî my most successful product by far.  Here‚Äôs what I did differently this time:  1. Habit of writing down ideas  I created a habit of constantly writing down problems and ideas ‚Äî whether it was something I personally experienced or something I saw others struggle with online.  I use a simple notes system on my phone and just add ideas whenever something clicks.  When it came time to build a new project, I had dozens of ideas to choose from ‚Äî most weren‚Äôt great, but a few stood out. BigIdeasDB was one of them.  2. Validating before building  This was the biggest difference-maker.  Instead of immediately building the product, I spent time figuring out if it was something others would care about.  I shared the idea on Reddit and Twitter, reached out to founders, and asked questions like:  Do you struggle to find good product ideas?  Would you use a database of validated problems from real sources like Reddit, G2, and Upwork?  The responses were super positive. That gave me the confidence to move forward.  3. Asking users what they want  Once I launched the MVP, I stayed close to my users. I asked them:  What‚Äôs missing?  What would help you more?  What do you actually want to build next?  This approach made it so much easier to know what to build. I didn‚Äôt waste time guessing ‚Äî I just built what users asked for.  4. Tracking metrics  I started tracking everything ‚Äî website conversion rates, user activation behavior, and upgrade funnels.  I could see exactly:  How many visitors converted to users  How many of those became paying customers  What actions made people more likely to convert  For example, my landing page was only converting at around 5% early on. I focused on improving that, and after a few changes, I got it to 10%, which had a direct impact on revenue.  TL;DR  I had to fail multiple times before I figured out how to build something people actually wanted.  The biggest change this time was validating the idea early ‚Äî but combining that with real user feedback and clear metrics made everything easier.  If you‚Äôre still trying to get your first win, don‚Äôt give up. Build small, talk to users, and make sure you‚Äôre solving something real."}

Looking for feedback on whether this would be a helpful tool, especially from current students, anyone in academia, etc  Also wondering if there is sufficient interest in extra features such as choosing which sources to specifically pull from (e.g. an applied math major linking \"Journal of Applied Mathematics\" so they get better source/insights)  The problem: AI tools confidently make up \"facts\" all the time, and it's getting harder to tell what's real. Students are submitting papers with made-up citations, researchers are wasting time chasing phantom studies, and writers are unknowingly spreading misinformation.   Example scenario:    GPT: \"'A Raisin in the Sun,' the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by Lorraine Hansberry, was written in 1957\"    User: \"Are you sure?\"    GPT: \"Yes, this well-known play was indeed written in April of 1957\"    User: \"Can you double check?\"    GPT: \"After double checking, I can confirm that this well-known play was indeed written in April of 1957\"    User: \"No, it was actually 1959\"    GPT: \"That was an astute observation! You are correct, 'A Raisin in the Sun' was written in 1959. I apologize for my mistake.\"    What Trudo does:     You paste your text (essay, article, research, whatever)    It highlights questionable claims and traces them to actual sources    Connects directly to JSTOR, PubMed, and arXiv - not Wikipedia or random blogs    Shows you what's legit vs. what might be AI hallucination    I'm still in beta, but the early results are pretty eye-opening. Found a lot of \"historical facts\" that were completely made up, scientific claims with zero backing, and citations that don't exist.  Questions for you:    Is this something you'd actually use?    What other sources would be valuable to include?    Any features that would make this more useful?"}

Let me explain;  Software has been by far the most lucrative and scalable type of business in the last decades. 7 out of the 10 richest people in the world got their wealth from software products. This is why software engineers are paid so much too.  But at the same time software was one of the hardest spaces to break into. Becoming a good enough programmer to build stuff had a high learning curve. Months if not years of learning and practice to build something decent. And it was either that or hiring an expensive developer; often unresponsive ones that stretched projects for weeks and took whatever they wanted to complete it.  When chatGpt came out we saw a glimpse of what was coming. But people I personally knew were in denial. Saying that llms would never be able to be used to build real products or production level apps. They pointed out the small context window of the first models and how they often hallucinated and made dumb mistakes. They failed to realize that those were only the first and therefore worst versions of these models we were ever going to have.  We now have models with 1 Millions token context windows that can reason and make changes to entire code bases. We have tools like AppAlchemy that prototype apps in seconds and AI first code editors like Cursor that allow you move 10x faster. Every week I‚Äôm seeing people on twitter that have vibe coded and monetized entire products in a matter of weeks, people that had never written a line of code in their life.

Confusing landing pages kill interest immediately  Products that fail or underperform have a very confusing landing page content and structure. Almost 50% of submissions didn't explain these 3 questions ->    What the product Does    What problem it solves    Who's it for    2. Beautiful UI doesn‚Äôt matter if the product doesn‚Äôt work  I saw beautiful landing pages for products that had no working demo. I also saw clunky UIs solving painful problems. Asthetics matter , but not as much as the main purpose.  3. Most founders couldn‚Äôt explain their product in one sentence  60% of products were not able to be explained in  single line by their founders. (I has a seperate section in a submission form where the builders are asked to explain what their product does in a single sentence). There only a gap of 5 second that you've got to explain the user who is coming in about what your product does. Only a handful of products from the 150 submitted were able to do this.  4. Building in silence doesn't work anymore  I sent around 500 emails/cold DMs to builders asking them to submit their product to my website . The submission is completely free , only take a minute or 2 to do and can impact their product greatly by increasing its visibility. But only a small percentage followed through.This reminded me that marketing and visibility matter just as much as building.Getting the word out there is as important as building the product itself  5. ‚ÄúAI-powered‚Äù ‚â† useful  I saw a dozens of AI powered tools for solving problems that can be done without using AI at all. I can understand that it is the new buzz word , but we have to chill out using the term \"AI powered\" everywhere. Tools that perform well usually don't advertise the AI part and focus on the actual value that the user gets  These 150 submissions were a great indiaction in what makes indie products work:    Be clear    Solve something real    Market without shame    Don‚Äôt get lost in the buzzwords    If you've built something cool and actually want to hear feedback and get seen , comment down below and I will give you my honest opinion. Any feedback about my site is also greatly appreciated !"}

So I wanted to share them and why.  ‚ö°My SaaS app:¬†https://snapnest.co¬†- The simplest way to manage your screenshots. Upload, organise, tag, and share screenshots in seconds.    NextJS¬†- Framework to build the frontend    Why:¬†The most important reason to go with NextJS was SSR (Server Side Rendering) as this is a big plus for SEO (Search engine optimisation) which helps get indexed and ranked better on google search. Also the performance is great!  2.¬†Express¬†- Framework to build backend apis  Why:¬†Simply because this is one of the most familiar frameworks for me and community support for it is massive easy to setup and deploy.  3.¬†Typescript¬†- Programming Language  Why:¬†This is a must if you are serious about your project and want to scale it as the codebase grows with your app maintaining vanilla javascript is a nightmare typescript will save you hours of debugging and give you the best DX when dealing with types.  4. Google Analytics - General analytics  Why: I wanted something reliable & free with a great mobile app. There's definitely better tools out there for this but I liked to check stats on my phone. It's also incredibly simple to set up and powerful out the box  5.¬†ImprovMX¬†- Email forwarding service  Why:¬†If you're just starting out and want a professional-looking contact email without paying for services like MailChimp, you can set up¬†email forwarding¬†from your domain name to your personal email. This gives a professional appearance without added cost.Example:¬†support@snapnest.co¬†‚Üí¬†personal@gmail.com  6.¬†Dodopayments¬†- Payments  If you're operating from India, receiving international payments can be a hassle. Dodopayments solves that problem the integration is super easy, and onboarding literally takes just 24 hours to go live. While fees and taxes can be a bit high, there aren‚Äôt many other options currently available for accepting payments worldwide while operating from India.  7. Amazon Web Services - Platform hosting  Why:¬†Whilst I don't think this route is for everyone, I am very familiar with AWS and it gives be practically unlimited flexibility with regards to the what I want to build. Services I use: RDS, CloudFront, EC2. They're also super cheap at low usage (and as you scale depending on how you architect).  8.¬†Vercel¬†- Platform to host NextJS application  Why:¬†First free tier is super generous and it's literally built to host NextJS application so the support and DX is the best on Vercel.  9.¬†NGINX¬†- Routing  Why:¬†snapnest.co¬†subdomain routing is built upon this. Checkout¬†virtual hosts¬†with NGINX for more info on how to host subdomains for your product.  How about your product? What do you use? Anything I should add to this list?"}

Overworked staff often miss these critical touchpoints, leading to preventable readmissions, missed billing opportunities, and frustrated patients.  The Challenge:    62% of patients say timely follow-ups are key to their satisfaction, yet clinics struggle to keep up.    7% of calls go unanswered in healthcare, costing practices up to $45,000 daily in lost revenue.    Nurses and front-desk teams are stretched thin, balancing administrative tasks with patient care.    The Solution: LUNA‚Äôs AI Patient Follow-up automates personalized, HIPAA-compliant check-ins via text or email. It‚Äôs not about replacing staff‚Äîit‚Äôs about giving them back time to focus on complex cases while ensuring no patient falls through the cracks.  Why It Works:    Patients get timely updates without feeling like they‚Äôre talking to a robot.    Nurses reclaim hours for high-value care, reducing burnout.    Clinics see fewer no-shows and better patient outcomes.    Thought Starter: How would your clinic change if routine follow-ups handled themselves? Could AI be the silent partner your team needs?"}

What‚Äôs worked well for me:  Constant feedback loops with users, i talk to clients regularly and update the product based on what they actually need.  Built from experience, the roadmaps are based on what worked for me personally. I have 11k+ LinkedIn connections, 2k+ on X and I‚Äôve spent months experimenting on Reddit.  Collaborations,like reaching out and building with others in public helped me get early traction.  Still small, but steadily growing as i'm actively improving it every day.

I've made $301 with my product, and although it may not seem like a lot, I'm ecstatic right now!  On Apr 30, I officially launched WaitlistNow, but the difference between many other products in my field is that I priced it as a lifetime deal instead of a subscription model. I didn't expect much difference, but I hoped it would help.  So I did these things    Sent an email to existing people on the waitlist    Posted on twitter, bluesky, peerlist, etc.    Posted on Reddit    Had one affiliate deal    And the rest is history (maybe small for others but big for me)  On the first day after launching, I got 2 sales, and just a few days later, I received my 3rd sale.  Sales were slowing a bit, so I decided to remove my free plan entirely and that boosted sales again.  One of the users even reached out to me, complimenting me on what I had built and how it was a great idea, which meant the world to me. It meant that what I built is leaving an impact on others.  I am happy beyond words :)  I am even happier as people are loving the product that I made. I have received so much good feedback, and it makes me even happier that people are actually engaging with the product and making waitlists, and validating their ideas.  Also, affiliate deals are a good way to boost sales in the start so I would recommend it to others.  One lesson I have, is don't do freemium, I thought it was a good model until I tested it but most people who use the free plan, aren't really serious users so it's better to just have the paid plan and a refund period like what I do.  I hope this brings smiles to all reading this post :) and inspires a few of you.  PS - Here is a link to my product:¬†https://www.waitlistsnow.com/¬†. The next goal for me is to keep grinding and get up to $500 in sales."}

People are getting weary and losing trust. Do you really think everyone is collecting infinite subscriptions or buying infinite tokens for AI services that disappear as fast as they appear?  Where is the substance, the real gain, in building tools that exist just to help you build more tools so more ‚Äúfounders‚Äù can launch more AI toys?  Twitter and Reddit are flooded with posts like¬†‚ÄúI made $100K out of thin air in a couple of months with my SaaS and I can tell you how for a price,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy new SaaS can tell you if your SaaS is valuable,‚Äù ‚ÄúMy SaaS can create fake visitors for your SaaS,‚Äù ‚ÄúI vibe-coded a SaaS that improves your SaaS SEO,‚Äù ‚ÄúI was tired of thinking for myself so I vibe-coded a SaaS that does it for you,‚Äù¬†and so on.  It‚Äôs full of SaaS bros saying,¬†‚ÄúBro, it is so easy to make a living creating and selling SaaS. I‚Äôm bro-coding my third SaaS while selling the second for $200K, easy bro, easy.‚Äù  I‚Äôve looked into the profiles of these self-proclaimed ‚ÄúSaaS gurus‚Äù who claim to be doing amazing things by launching a new SaaS every four months. What I found were lots of insecure man-children who swore NFTs and memecoins were the future four years ago; people who repeat the same success stories again and again but run and hide when you ask basic questions about their products; and tons of folks playing at being successful ‚Äúfounders‚Äù because living a fake online life feels better.  For each of them, there are a thousand gullible simps claiming it has never been easier to make a full-time living by vibe-coding SaaS solo and pointing to ‚Äútons of examples‚Äù of founders selling their tools like hotcakes.  Look, I‚Äôm not saying nobody has built a successful AI-driven product and made real money. I‚Äôve followed genuine cases of people who hit the jackpot in record time. But statistically, it‚Äôs impossible for everyone to be doing so well. Given human nature, the ratio of fakers to genuine successes is huge, and those desperate to prove their achievements only erode trust because real winners don‚Äôt crave validation and they aren‚Äôt begging for attention in subreddits; they‚Äôre being interviewed by specialized media.  Is it easier than ever to create an online product that sells? Yes, I believe that. But competition is fiercer than ever. Ninety percent of founders are creating products to sell to other founders, watering down the AI bubble. Frontends and monetization models all start to look the same, breeding doubt and distrust.  Personally, with the help of AI, I built and automated a website offering a genuine service that now generates modest revenue through ads and subscriptions. I didn‚Äôt brand it as an AI tool; it looks and feels like a legacy-style service. My users aren‚Äôt other developers but a specific niche of non-technical people. I‚Äôve been working on it for months and keep optimizing it. I want to distance my site from the current Apple-like ‚Äúclean‚Äù aesthetics and startup jargon. I don‚Äôt want to develop for other developers at all. My goal is not to inflate the AI bubble but to use AI behind the scenes and earn a side income.  I‚Äôve studied REAL cases of mega-successful AI startups sold for BIG money: an eco-app that calculates the carbon footprint of any online purchase, a system that translates haute couture sketches into 3D runway-ready models, a cost-efficient platform that finds the best supplier for small and medium food chains, and so on. Notice anything in common? Their purpose is not to build or market more AI tools. They target very specific niche problems far outside the ‚Äúfounder/dev‚Äù echo chamber."}

I‚Äôm currently getting daily visits and a small but steadily growing revenue from ads and subscriptions. The core idea is so simple that anyone could copy it over a weekend with a no-code AI-assisted tool, but the implementation and branding were manually optimized to the core.  USE AI ASSISTANCE, BUT DON‚ÄôT TRUST IT    AI-driven tools can produce a working product in minutes, but that doesn‚Äôt mean they give you an efficient backend that runs smoothly, a database schema that can handle years of data without surpassing free-tier limits, or a frontend and branding that truly boost your marketing.    I prototyped the backend in a single day with AI, then spent a month stress-testing and optimizing every edge case. Now that script runs every 15 minutes on Render‚Äôs free tier, fetching, filtering and processing all my data without breaking a sweat.    Almost nobody tweaks the database a no-code AI tool spits out, and their search engines bloat with useless junk. The AI assistants I used (I tried many) all created an automatic Node.js solution for a search engine that almost 80% of websites are using now and that is really slow and hoards tons of unnecessary data in your database. That‚Äôs why I designed my own Supabase schema and built a custom search engine ready for years of data while still staying on the free plan.    Most AI-generated frontends look like sterile clones crowded with React plugins. I went back to zero by using Astro for static builds, Svelte islands for interactivity, not a single generic React component, plus a distinct branding layer. The result is fast, functional and very distinct from the thousands of white or black themed pages that look like perfume magazine ads from the 90s.    ASK RELEVANT QUESTIONS, BUT DON‚ÄôT TRUST EVERYONE OR CRAVE VALIDATION    Keeping the project in stealth mode was crucial. I didn‚Äôt post every line of code to r/dev or r/SaaS asking for feedback. That kind of help often turns into espionage, someone forks your repo over a weekend and you‚Äôre left with nothing.    For example, a dev launched a killer service to capture full-page screenshots of sites that update daily. Brilliant idea, but he promoted it in every developer subreddit. Who showed up? Hundreds of devs sniffing around how it works instead of the designers or marketers who would actually pay for it.    The trick is knowing who you‚Äôre talking to. If your target is designers, go to r/Design or creative communities; if it‚Äôs restaurateurs, find chef forums or food entrepreneur groups. Sell the real benefit (forget manual screenshots, save three hours a month), not your tech stack.    Nowadays, almost any idea is easy to copy, but the hard part is execution, branding and maintenance. Work quietly, polish your backend, your database, your frontend and your branding, and get feedback from your real users, not self-proclaimed gurus in your own little puddle."}

So basically, they are skipping in marketing:    The pre-launch stage    The launch stage    And when the SaaS tool is already in the market, that‚Äôs when they want to start marketing.  Some founders even try to do everything by themselves, hoping they will attract users.  The worst part is, without even understanding the ICP, you can‚Äôt target every platform and can‚Äôt expect results without a strategy in place.  So here are some basics you should understand:  1. Know your ICP (Ideal Client Profile)  Your ICP is the target audience you are helping solve a problem through your product.  2. Find your ICP for feedback  Divide your SaaS into a few stages and test the basic version with beta users.  If you have a B2B SaaS, chances are your audience is active on LinkedIn, Reddit, X, and other forums.  If you have a B2C SaaS, chances are they‚Äôre active on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and similar platforms.  3. Understand your SaaS‚Äôs USP (Unique Selling Proposition)  You need to position your SaaS to stand out in the market compared to your competitors.  4. Strategy for Launch Stage  If you think launching on Product Hunt is the only way, that‚Äôs not true.  There are other websites that can give you users.  Plus, your pre-launch marketing strategy and beta users will help you gain early traction.  5. Post-Launch Stage  You need to understand from users which features improve your SaaS and which ones are unnecessary.  A continuous feedback loop from customers will refine your SaaS to the next level.  __________________  We recently helped a B2B SaaS founder gain brand awareness and leads using LinkedIn.

But after years of building SaaS products there‚Äôs one simple metric that shifted how I run my entire business. And its not one you‚Äôll find in any fancy dashboard.  It‚Äôs Time to First Value (TTFV).  What do I mean by that? The time it takes from a user signing up to them actually experiencing something meaningful or ‚Äúaha‚Äù in your product. That moment when they think ‚ÄúOh wow this is exactly what I needed.‚Äù  Here‚Äôs why it matters so much:    The faster someone hits that moment the more likely they stick around    It directly impacts onboarding success and user satisfaction    It‚Äôs often overlooked because it‚Äôs not about money but about user experience    Optimizing TTFV can slash churn before it even starts    How do you measure it? Look at user behavior flows and track when users complete key actions that define success in your product. Then work backward to remove friction in onboarding or features blocking that moment.  For example I had a SaaS where TTFV was 5 days on average. We worked hard to cut it down to under 24 hours by simplifying onboarding adding tooltips and improving defaults. The result? Retention shot up 30 percent in 2 months.  If you‚Äôre only obsessing over revenue numbers but ignoring how fast users get value you‚Äôre missing a massive growth lever.  Would love to hear if anyone else tracks TTFV or similar ‚Äúsoft‚Äù metrics that changed how you build your product. Let‚Äôs share stories and tactics!"}

Result:One lead called at¬†5:37 PM¬†for leak detection and repairs.Leak detection can cost $500, and total repairs can hit $1,300.  üìâ¬†Ad spend: $12üí∞¬†Lead value: ~$1,300üïí¬†AI agent cost: <$2 Why this matters: Most small businesses miss leads that come in¬†after hours. AI agents can keep the phone ‚Äústaffed‚Äù 24/7 and capture high-value customers without needing extra employees or complex tech stacks.  This works not just for pool services but for many local business:    Cleaners    Electricians    Plumbers    Contractors    Airbnbs / Boutique Hotels    Clinics & Massage Therapists    Real Estate Agents    Accountants    TLDR: i generated thousands in potential business leads for under $60 in ads + $4 in AI call handling."}

If not, it rotates out. That‚Äôs it.  At first, a few people submitted. Then more. Then people started visiting. I kept sharing it, fixing things, listening.  This month, the site hit 8000 visits.  That number still feels strange to me. I‚Äôve never built anything that reached that many people. I‚Äôm still answering every email myself. Still refreshing the dashboard like it‚Äôs day one.

It studies your writing and helps you stay consistent across chapters.  Character Interviews: Talk to your characters in real time to uncover their motivations, voice, and backstory, helps you tap into their psyche  Acts ‚Üí Chapters ‚Üí Scenes: A built in story structure that helps you organize without getting overwhelmed.  We‚Äôve focused a lot on making the UI beginner friendly while still offering depth for power users.  And we are still in beta so you can actually sign up for free and test it all out looking for some genuine feedback, we will also be offering early access thru our discord and reddit  So if all this interests you do give it a shot at¬†Novel Mage - AI-Powered Novel Writing Platform  Cheers and Happy writing"}

I am also working on ibankeralerts.com.  The standard advice is \"talk to customers,\" BUT that simple phrase hides a ton of work: finding the right people, writing emails that don't sound like spam, and actually getting those emails delivered.  After seeing so many builders without validating the market, I decided to build a service to fix it. Drawing on my interest in effective email marketing, I've created a productized service called Market Mulberry to run the validation and first-contact playbook for you.  This isn't a SaaS tool...  It's a one-time, \"done-with-you\" service designed to get you in front of potential customers.  The Offer  I‚Äôm launching this as a service for a flat fee of¬†$99.  Full transparency:¬†You cover the pass-through costs for data cleansing tools and the email infrastructure. I don't mark these up; you pay what they cost. This keeps the service affordable and transparent.  The Test: I recommend emailing 100 people, and if you're up for it, cold calling them, too.  Guarantee: This will be the best way to validate your market. If your product solves a head-on-fire problem, you will get responses. Funny story to share of product-market-fit if we ever talk.  I'm looking to work with a handful of founders to start. If you're building something new and need to de-risk the idea or find your first users, this is for you. Questions for the Community   What's your biggest roadblock when trying to find your first 10 customers?    Is this against the rules? I apologize in advance, if so.    If you're interested, you can learn more at¬†https://marketmulberry.lovable.app¬†or DM me with questions."}

It‚Äôs a lonely journey man...product, marketing, sales, customer support, you have to do everything by yourself.  One of the hardest parts early on is getting real feedback, traction and visibility. Reddit? Might get deleted by mods. Product Hunt? You‚Äôre just shouting into the void without a backing.  So I‚Äôm building a¬†no-BS, high-signal group,¬†no lurkers, no fluff, only builders. When you join, you must introduce your SaaS ‚Äî that's how we verify you. No intro = no entry.¬†There will be weekly pruning where the least/non-contributing members will be let go to keep the quality of the group sane.  If you're building SaaS, here‚Äôs what this group will offer:    The first group to test your product and give you feedback. No more begging strangers on Reddit or Discord.    Your first real users. People from the group will actually try your product and share feedback. If they like it, they‚Äôll drop testimonials for your SaaS for early traction and visibility. Some may even become paying customers if the love it.    A launch support crew. Whether you're posting on Reddit, Product Hunt, or Twitter, this group becomes your boost. You‚Äôll get real comments on your PH launch posts to maximise visibility, retweets, etc..advice on where and how to post, and the push to avoid being buried. No karma farming (have some rules in mind right now)    Structured spotlight days. You‚Äôll be assigned a dedicated day where the entire group focuses JUST on your product ‚Äî feedback, distribution help, growth hacks, launch prep. This rotates so every founder gets quality attention, not just a firehose of links. Based on leaderboard. So higher contribution - higher spotlight days.¬†If someone in the group is not helping your product during this day, they will be removed in the next phase to keep only the helpful members. I know its rude but we gotta do it to increase the quality.    A leaderboard and accountability. Top contributors get visibility, not just praise. You help others, you get priority when it's your turn. Zero tolerance for lurking.    A voice channel¬†where you will pitch your product to everyone so that you can practice enough before meeting with investors. Will improve your communication skills. Even if you are an introvert, this will help you get over that fear of selling and getting rejected.    A quality-first feedback cycle, inspired by what YC built. YC has its private forum for honest product discussions. Why can‚Äôt we have something similar ‚Äî a tight-knit circle for ambitious SaaS builders who want to grow fast without noise?

A few days ago, I shared that CaptureKit got acquired (super exciting!), and I wanted to follow up with how the actual transfer process went.  After selling LectureKit 4 months ago, this time I felt a bit more prepared, but still figured it might help others to see what the handoff looked like for this project too.  Here‚Äôs how it went:  Code & GitHub Repos:CaptureKit had multiple repos: the Next.js frontend, Fastify API server, 2 AWS Lambdas, the docs site, and a small free tool.I just transferred ownership of all the relevant GitHub repos to the buyer‚Äôs account, and he self hosted all of those using Coolify  AWS (Lambda, S3, Schedulers):The buyer invited me to their AWS org.I pushed the Lambdas and other infra there, configured everything, set up correct roles, S3, permissions, and CloudWatch triggers.Smooth and pretty quick once you know what you're doing.  Database (MongoDB):He invited me to his MongoDB Atlas org, and I just moved the CaptureKit project into it. Done in a few clicks.  Email Provider (Resend):I was using Resend for transactional emails.Just invited him as an owner on the Resend project.  Domain (Namecheap):Used Namecheap again. I generated the transfer code and he used it to claim the domain from his own provider.Easy process with Namecheap.  Payments (LemonSqueezy ‚Üí Stripe):This was actually simpler than I thought.I was using LemonSqueezy, he‚Äôs using Stripe.So I canceled the active subs in LemonSqueezy, and he offered those users an awesome discount to re-subscribe under Stripe. Otherwise, I'd probably email the Lemon support for transferring ownership  to his account.  That‚Äôs pretty much it!Another clean handoff, and another small project off to a new home üôå  (It took around 3-4 days)  If you‚Äôre thinking of selling a side project and have questions, feel free to ask!Happy to share what I‚Äôve learned.

Some of the ideas we‚Äôre testing include:    Profiles showing created/saved tours, photos, and linked socials    Drag-and-drop itinerary builder with AI help for writing stop descriptions    Instagram-style visual feed of community trips    Images can be posted to a Tour, to create a collection of memories across all people who started experienced this tour      Commenting, following, voting ‚Äî all the good social stuff    An AI engine that recommends stops based on your interests and past travel    Option to create public, private, or draft itineraries    Creator monetization ideas (e.g., ‚ÄúBook a Tour With Me‚Äù or selling premium guides)    It‚Äôs still very MVP-stage ‚Äî we‚Äôve built out a lot of the tech but are figuring out if this is something people actually¬†want, and if so, what use case sticks hardest: planning, sharing, social discovery, or something else?  Would really appreciate any thoughts ‚Äî especially from folks who travel often, follow travel creators, or have tried building something in this space. Happy to answer questions or clarify anything I left vague."}

From the moment I got the idea to writing the first line of code, I posted daily on X and Reddit about my progress and the features I was building also a few viral posts made all this possible.  The key takeaway:¬†building in public is a must¬†if you want to reach your customers. Start from day one don‚Äôt hold back.  Good luck!

Everyone on Twitter is telling you to share your story, post your numbers, document everything.They say the crowd will show up. Revenue will follow.  All nonsense.  Here's what actually happens:    You chase dopamine, not dollars You get likes, comments, maybe a blue check retweet. Now you're hooked on fake validation. You start working for claps, not customers.    You forget what actually matters Instead of writing code or closing a deal, you're busy crafting a post about your tech stack. It feels productive. It's not.    You enter the founder echo chamber Other indie hackers cheering you on doesn't mean you're solving a real problem. They aren't your customers. They can't pay you.    You give away your playbook Your CAC, your roadmap, your feature plans. Every post helps your competitors copy or counter you faster.    You confuse engagement with traction Likes aren't revenue. Followers aren't customers. Retweets aren't product-market fit.    You waste a ridiculous amount of time Writing posts, designing visuals, replying to comments... it adds up to hours every week. That time could be used for fixing bugs or talking to actual users.    You attract the \"advice avalanche\" Suddenly everyone is an expert. Hot takes, growth hacks, recycled advice. 99% of it is noise from people who haven't built anything in years.    You turn Stripe into content Posting \"$1k MRR\" screenshots is just the startup version of gym selfies. Your customers don‚Äôt care. Ship value, not screenshots.    You create invisible pressure You feel like you always need to post. Always need to show progress. This leads to rushed features, fake momentum, and eventual burnout.    You get market-blind Your tweets get likes, so you assume the product is working. It‚Äôs not. Likes don't mean you‚Äôre solving a real problem.    Here's what you should do instead:    Build in private. Sell in public.    Share results, not the process. Nobody cares how the sausage gets made.    Hang out where your customers are. Not where other founders like to lurk.    Build for your users.Not Twitter.Not Indie Hackers.Not Reddit.Not your ego.  The best founders I know aren't building in public.They're building in focus. Quietly. Ruthlessly.  Here's my site: https://efficiencyhub.org/I built it, then talked about it. Then I got traction.

Stuff that feels like hey, you could actually help here. And then it gives me a way to respond that doesn‚Äôt sound spammy or weird.  At first it was just for me. I used it for my own SaaS tools and started getting more replies and more leads than I ever did with cold outreach or SEO."}

It was a goldmine for early feedback and spotting market gaps. When they switched to paid-only, I was a sad dude.  What I realised: don‚Äôt get too attached to a single channel, especially when you don‚Äôt control the rules. Platforms will always change - and often not in your favour. But communities DON'T. Be platform analogous, and find 'your people'. I doubled down on automating customer insights from forums like reddit and public review sites and a big component of IdeaFloat is centered around this.  So here's some tips about how to come up with ideas that don't suck.  Firstly: Knowledge is power, and niche is your advantage. When you really dig into a tiny corner of the internet - say homebrewers on a sub-1000-member Reddit, or spreadsheet macros for accountants - you start to spot stuff nobody else does. Your point of difference is either: a) doing something in a way no one else is doing (like building a Chrome extension that auto-formats vegan recipes into macros) or b) doing something that nobody else can do (because you‚Äôve lived it, breathed it, broken your back on it). Think of a subject that you know more about than anyone else and DIG DEEP. If you don't have one, start becoming an expert in something TODAY!  Secondly: Don't worry about the method of building. Don't worry if it's a wrapper. Don't even worry if your first MVP is going to 'suck'. Good ideas don't need perfection. What I learned very early on in my career is that tech stacks are ultimately a blocker to success in most cases and we focus way too much on them. What you need to be focusing on is finding your idea and validating it as soon as possible.  Finally: Be where your users are. hunt for conversations where your users actually hang out and get involved. Gummysearch for example is a great tool for this SPECIFICALLY for reddit, but you dont need AI or a platform to do this - you can do it yourself with a search bar and pen and paper. Ink quill. Whatever works. Here‚Äôs a few community-based hacks:    reddit ‚Äì Jump into niche subs and search ‚Äúhow do you‚Ä¶?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat sucks about‚Ä¶?‚Äù threads. Bookmark the ones with the longest comment chains. Those are pain points waiting for fixes. E.G. Go to the capcut subreddit - it‚Äôs huge but all people do is complain about capcut there. THAT‚ÄôS MONEY.    G2 ‚Äì Filter by ‚Äúpoorly rated‚Äù features and read the one-star reviews. You‚Äôll find ‚Äúwhy‚Äù people hate tools. Build something that fixes just that one thing and you‚Äôre 10x more compelling.    etsy ‚Äì Check the ‚Äúbest seller‚Äù tags in micro-niches (like pet memorials or handmade knitting charts). Read the reviews‚Äîbuyers always mention what they wish was different.    IdeaFloat ‚Äì I built it to pull all that forum chatter, review feedback and Q&A into one dashboard + validate your ideas and tell you when you will make money. But again, you don‚Äôt need fancy AI to start. just copy-paste threads into a doc and highlight recurring words if you want. That‚Äôs your gold.    Don‚Äôt overthink fancy methods. Just listen, learn and lean into what you know. Go find your people, solve their actual problems, and you‚Äôll end up with ideas that actually stick.  Ok, go make something awesome.  I have a lot more to say about this but just keeping it high level today!"}

Because it does't make any sense to have a form on landing page that you can't integrate with data and if you want to do it, you need to integrate backend and database and make sure everything works.

That‚Äôs 11 months of effort for $19.99 on my product, BigIdeaDB.  It was incredibly hard to reach that point, and it was the greatest feeling in the world.  But once you go from 0 to 1, something changes.  1 month after getting my first paying customer, I hit $600.  3 months after, $3,800.  5 months after, $12,000.  7 months after, $17,200.  In the beginning you have to fight for those first users and paying customers.  The market is crowded, competitive, and you have no social proof or following. Getting your message through all this noise is not easy.  But eventually someone gives your product a shot. One user grows to a few, you get a little bit of social proof for your product, and it becomes easier for new people to try it.  If you serve your first customers well, listen to their feedback, and help them solve their problems, they will begin recommending you to others.  And just like that, real growth begins.  You also know your target audience better now, which marketing channels worked, and where you should double down.  It gets easier.  My game plan was simple:    I kept taking daily action even when I was met with silence, no new signups, and rejections in DMs.    At the end of each day, I looked back on what I had done and wrote down one thing I would improve the next day.    Then I implemented the improvement, and kept going.    If you‚Äôre in the 0 to 1 phase right now, you just have to keep going.  I know that it‚Äôs hard right now. It‚Äôs the hardest part, and I say that from my own experience.  And I can also say that if you don‚Äôt quit, you get to see the other side of it."}

Some users have even repurchased just to support the project  Market: B2B ‚Äî agencies, lead gen pros, local SEO, marketers  Features: AI-enhanced lead generation tool, no ongoing API costs  Tech stack:  Website: Next.js, Vercel, Stripe, Resend, Cloudflare  App: Electron, React, TailwindCSS, and a commercial licensing system  The app could also be transitioned into a SaaS with relatively few changes, licensing and structure already support that model  The app's been solid, I still get emails from customers saying they love it, and it barely costs anything to keep running. But I haven‚Äôt done much to grow it. I‚Äôve posted about it a few times and had some affiliates help out, but that‚Äôs about it.

My girlfriend is a doctorate student and I was watching her screen papers for her systematic review and the process seemed super slow and tedious.  For those who don't know, a systematic review is essentially an analysis of existing research. So you get a bunch of studies together, decide which ones to include (this is the tedious part because you have to read a bunch of long wordy PDFs), and then analyse them all together.  So I built an app to do it faster using AI. It's not perfect - it's still worth manually checking the results to confirm what the AI says, but it's correct the majority of the time and can help you notice things in the paper you otherwise wouldn't have.  Here‚Äôs how it works:    Upload your papers (PDF files).    Specify your inclusion/exclusion criteria.    Let the AI do the work. It will tell you which papers to include/exclude, along with a summary of why it made that decision.    (Optional) You can also mark your own final decision for each paper, to allow you to check the AI‚Äôs results and agree or disagree with it.    Export the results as a CSV file.    There‚Äôs a lot more this app¬†could¬†do but I wanted to launch it and get it out there for people to try it out and provide feedback, so that I can add the features people actually want rather than trying to guess.  I realise most people here are probably not in academia and not the target audience - but I wanted to share it here and see if I could get some feedback from fellow builders.  There are quite a few apps in this space with a lot of features mine doesn't have. The main one is Rayann, but that is more of an assistant that helps you screen papers rather than actually doing it for you. So, rather than trying to offer an \"all in one\" solution I made basically a 1-feature app that does one thing well.  Here's the link:¬†https://www.researchpaperscreener.com/  I would love to know what you guys think of the app or my strategy in general. Besides posting on reddit, how do you think I should approach marketing this?"}

AI Appointment Scheduling  Patients can book, reschedule, or cancel over the phone or text ‚Äî 24/7 ‚Äî no human needed. ‚û°Ô∏è Result: Clinics using these agents cut down no-shows and free up front-desk staff for more urgent needs.  ‚∏ª  üìû 2. AI Patient Follow-Up  Post-visit agents automatically check in on symptoms, medications, or recovery steps via voice or SMS. ‚û°Ô∏è Why it matters: It reduces patient drop-off and improves outcomes without overloading nurses or staff.  ‚∏ª  üßæ 3. AI Insurance Verification  Verifies eligibility, benefits, and coverage in real time before appointments. ‚û°Ô∏è What clinics gain: Fewer billing errors, faster intake, and less back-and-forth with insurance reps.  ‚∏ª  ‚öôÔ∏è What Makes This Work So Well? ‚Ä¢\tAI voice agents don‚Äôt sleep ‚Äî they handle calls after hours, weekends, and peak times ‚Ä¢\tThey follow scripts precisely, reducing errors or forgotten steps ‚Ä¢\tAnd they integrate with EHRs, CRMs, or even just Google Sheets depending on the setup  üí¨ Curious what others think‚Ä¶  If your clinic, hospital, or wellness office has tried AI tools ‚Äî what worked?

No more \"wait, what did we decide on that?\" moments.    Follow-up emails write themselves basically.    Saves me about 5 hours a week on meeting admin.    Best part: She's not trying to replace anyone or be some flashy AI bot. She just quietly does the boring stuff so you can focus on the actual conversation.  Been using it for client calls, team standups, and those brutal stakeholder meetings. Works the same across all of them.  Anyone else tried meeting AI assistants? Most of them are either too basic or trying to do too much. This one actually feels like having a really good assistant who just... gets it.  PS: Not affiliated with them or anything, just genuinely tired of meeting burnout and this actually helped. Happy to answer questions if anyone's curious about the setup process or how it handles different meeting types."}

You just need to talk the way you talk - even if it‚Äôs an unstructured mess of words.  All of this is done in 10-15 mins.

The Problem: You know you need an AI solution for your business ‚Äì maybe for marketing automation, customer support, or data analysis. You search online, and what do you get? Endless \"Top 10 AI Tools of 2025\" articles. Most are generic, sponsored, and don't actually help you figure out which tool has the specific features you need at a price point that makes sense. I wasted countless hours on free trials and demos for software that wasn't the right fit.  My Solution: I created FittableAI (https://fittableai.com).  The name says it all ‚Äì it's about finding the most fittable AI for you. Instead of just listing popular tools, FittableAI lets you:    Search by specific features: Need an AI chatbot that integrates with Slack and supports Korean? You can actually search for that.    Compare solutions side-by-side: Get a clear overview of pricing, features, and target users without juggling 10 different tabs.    Get AI-powered recommendations: Based on your input, our own AI suggests the best-fit solutions, saving you even more time.    I built this for founders, marketers, and anyone who wants to leverage AI without the headache of finding the right tool. My goal is to make AI adoption easier and more transparent for everyone.  I would be incredibly grateful for any feedback from this community. What do you think of the concept? Is the site easy to use? What features would you like to see next?  Thanks for checking it out!"}

My product made $252 from lifetime deal sales.  What did I do ?  I just saw a list of fb groups that were specifically made for LTDs. I reached out to a few of these page admins for an affiliate partnership. I was selling my product for $39 LTD, and the affiliate partners got 30% on each sale. That's it, they posted about my product on their respective fb groups and 60% of the revenue came from those groups.  You can do the same if you are looking to grow your initial user base or can afford to do a lifetime deal for your product.  I could do a LTD because my product is a front-end heavy application and I don't have any server expenses yet.  It's a no-code waitlist creation tool that automates the entire process of creating a waitlist(DB, analytics, good design) to help founders validate their product ideas.  You can check it out here, currently available for a $39 lifetime deal (I have a special coupon LIMITED10 which will give $10 off and is available until June 5th, use it at checkout and it will bring the price down to $29)  I hope my little growth story helps a few of you and motivates you to also market your product on fb groups.  PS - If you also run a newsletter / community, I would invite you to join the¬†affiliate program https://preview.redd.it/my-product-has-made-250-so-far-in-may-v0-8xf43mwves2f1.png"}

No fluff, no excuses‚Äîjust focused execution.  Here‚Äôs exactly how it goes:  Day 1: Ideation + Vibe Coding We start with a strategy call to dig into your idea, your audience, and your vision. Within hours, I‚Äôm ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù a working prototype using Lovable to bring the flow and experience to life immediately after our call. You‚Äôll see it evolve in real time.  Days 2‚Äì4: Full Build on Bubble (or similar) Once the prototype is locked, I build the actual app with clean UI, smart workflows, and real AI integrations using Bubble, FlutterFlow, or a no-code stack that fits your product. We iterate fast. You review and refine daily.  Day 5‚Äì6: Testing + Demo Prep We stress-test flows, polish the UX, connect any backend tools you need, and prep for a smooth live walkthrough. If you're raising, we‚Äôll tune the product to show well in investor or customer calls.  Day 7: You Go Live By the end of the week, your app is live on a custom domain, demo-ready, and 100% owned by you. Whether it's a subscription SaaS, AI productivity tool, or niche AI-powered assistant, you walk away with something real.  Whether you‚Äôre just starting or already have a vision, I can help you shape, ship, and showcase your idea. No-code doesn‚Äôt mean no value. Execution beats talk, and I‚Äôm here to build alongside you.  Drop a comment or DM me if you‚Äôre ready to stop sitting on that great idea of yours and finally launch."}

My last company had me covering 26 states. I was remote from the office. I was doing 40+% travel. I did it for 8 years. The first 5ish was pre-Covid and it was fun. Make a couple of appointments, plan the trip, then fill in the in between time with last minute meetings or drop ins. Ate out every night.  Then Covid hit. Company restricted travel for 5 months. Once we were able to get back on the road, it was completely different. People were remote, doors were locked, things needed to be scheduled in advance and only for \"needs\" vs my wants. In a 3 day trip, I'd go from 3 scheduled meetings and 3 or 4 last minute/drop ins to 1 meeting. Maaaaaybe 2. Things would be canceled last minute, regardless of I had flown in for that specific meeting. Takeout only for dinner.  Then, I got recruited into my current company, same industry/role, still remote.  Much smaller territory but more money and volume of sales. It went from 3 day trip to see 1 customer to an hour drive. It went from 50+ hotel stays a year to 5 or 6. Most of my stays are within a 2 hour drive and usually because someone else (management) is in town or a conference/trade show, plus the occasional trip to the office.  I thought I would miss the \"thrill\" of the travel adventure. New cities, states, rentals etc. You get the idea. Guess what? I don't. At all. Looking back, I can't believe I did it for 8 years.  This week, there is a conference at my nearby city (45 min drive depending on traffic). Originally I was going to just drive in but the restricted the number of people from my company going (after things were booked/hotels reserved) so I decided to take over one of the rooms and am now staying over for the 2 nights. This is what my travel is now, 2 nights in a hotel 45 minutes from my house."}

I told him he was going to look like an asshole because we are meeting with Midwest small farmers this afternoon, who likely have been up since 4am and will be likely in the same attire they started they day in, will be tired, and really doing us a favor by taking more time to meet with us. I told him we will likely be touring their setup walking through mud from the constant rain we had and shit in barns.  You can‚Äôt win a client by dressing to impressing, you win them by showing up and showing you‚Äôre down to earth and care about all the ins and outs of their business. For reference I wore nice-ish jeans, cowboy boots, and a dark polo. Also the kid wanted to take his Mercedes convertible and I told him no, we are taking my Ram 1500.  He also already had a plan of what to sell them, told him he needs to let the customer talk and we need to cater to his needs. Not ours. We have an idea of what they need from initial convos, and doesn‚Äôt matter we have a product paying us 2x on commission.

I did not make any sales, but my day was pretty productive. 2 of the demos I did today, prospects seemed highly interested, but mentioned wanting to speak with wife or business partner. Both told me to call them on Monday for a decision. I'd give each of those two a 75% chance of closing on Monday. Also got two other decisions on Monday that I put at 75% chance of closing. So Monday hopefully we start seeing the first sales from this challenge!  Guy A that I'm proposing a website to again rescheduled meeting to Tuesday. At least he notified me this time, so I don't have to call him to rebook.  Monday I'm also supposed to present website proposal to Guy B: pricing on that will be $3000 total, $1.5K upfront, $1.5K on completion and $80/mo hosting and support, let's hope he bites."}

What actually saw from watching 1000+ sales processes:  Stop trying to overcome objections prevent them instead. Most objections happen because you didn't qualify properly upfront. If price is always an issue, you're talking to broke prospects  Forget always be closing  always be disqualifying. The fastest way to more sales is saying no to bad fits quicker. I've seen reps double their close rate just by walking away from 30% of their opportunities  Your follow-up game is probably terrible. \"I'll follow up next week\" isn't follow-up. It's hoping. Real follow-up has specific value in every touchpoint  Speed matters more than perfection. A decent response in 5 minutes beats a perfect response in 5 hours. Every single time  Stop selling features, start selling outcomes. Nobody cares about your \"robust reporting dashboard.\" They care about \"cutting your month-end reporting from 3 days to 30 minutes\"  The companies crushing it aren't using secret sales hacks. They're just doing the basics consistently while everyone else chases shiny objects  I know this is not something new but these are fundamentals"}

They start you out with a few hundred clients (roughly $150k of revenue from the last year).  They have an office downtown and they expect new hires to be in the office most days as they get up and running. They claim they're cool with you going full remote eventually. That's important to me. The company has stellar reviews on Glassdoor and other websites. They're averaging like 4.3/5 stars from their employees.  Here's the downside... OTE is $45-65k the first year. $40k base pay. So it sounds like you hardly sell anything the first year. OTE for 2nd year is more like $60-80k.  Would probably take 4 years to earn $100k. I was making $120k at my old job 3 years ago (music equipment sales). I'm 35 now and I'm not excited about the idea of staying under $100k until I'm damn near 40. I'm looking to get a nicer house soon and start building more wealth. But... if I can stick it out, it sounds like a chill full remote b2b sales job.  Should I hold out for something better?

I'm using just a CRM with a built in dialer, not using any parallel dialer to make my calls  I sell to small businesses. Main software I sell is $299/yr, since price is so low, try to demo it on the cold call by them reviewing my email and clicking on a link to try the software. Then I ask if they want to buy, but most time they need at least a few days, so I ask if I can call them in a few days to confirm their decision. I also sell a software add-on that is a one time fee of $200.  I think 7 demoes in a day are decent, but now we'll need to see if they convert into sales later this week or next week. One of the demoed people is high probability sale, the rest medium to low probability. But we shall see  Also booked a meeting with an existing client to help him with implementing a software that I'm familiar with but not my software, for his business. Meeting is tomorrow, quoted him $500 for the help implement it, let's see.  I was supposed to get in by 8am. But was slacking and ended up in the office at 9am. Tried calling a guy, that had agreed to a meeting, he missed it. Started cold calling 9:15am to 11:46am made about 100 calls and had 2 demoes done at this point. Then took a bit over 1 hr off. Started calling around 1pm again for a few hours got up to 207 dials and 5 more demos Ended this period around 3:30pm. Rest of day went bad no more demos even though I went up to 302 dials, but maybe it was late in day for shops I was calling not sure.  I am exhausted, my ears hurt a bit from wearing the headset. But let's see over the week if this pays off. Only one client decision scheduled for tomorrow, but 8 client decisions are scheduled for Wednesday (some from calls I made today, others from calls I made last week), so maybe  Wednesday is a big day.  This is my record number of calls, I arrived late, should have got in earlier, but I didn't want to mess up my challenge on the first day so persevered through it."}

Our marketing person doesn‚Äôt want to market me and the sales department that I‚Äôm trying to build because my boss lets him get commission from every customer he gets off of marketing on social media and of course he doesn‚Äôt want those customers going to me. And I just feel like sales and marketing should work together :(  I feel so lost but I am so determined to make this work. I know and my boss knows that I am building an entire department alone and I just need someone to lead me in the right direction.  Also if anyone is wondering I make $35k salary and I get 10% commission from all sales that I bring in.  Edit: I have bought the book Founding Sales by Peter kazanjy"}

Salary and commission seemed normal and competitive. As I‚Äôm onboarding I soon realize that the majority of the commission is based on the deal closing (they estimate 5% of the average deal to make up that part of the commission so could be lower if a less lucrative deal closes but could be higher if let‚Äôs say a million dollar deal closes). The other part is based on the monthly SQL targets.  As I look into this further is apparent to me that the sales journey can be anywhere between 8-24 months (most likely probably around the 8-15 month mark). This means that I won‚Äôt see 60% of my commission until well into next year maybe even the year after that. And of course if I leave or get fired than they won‚Äôt back pay me for my deals that get closed after I leave.  On top of that the SQL has a cap (although I‚Äôve been told this would be removed). I feel uneasy mentioning this as I am not even 3 weeks in to this new job and am still onboarding/learning the product.  Also I understand I haven‚Äôt been in sales long and maybe this is quite normal? Looking to reach out to the community and see what their thoughts are on this.

We have some items to tie up and then send off by Friday.  The customer is looking to choose a vendor by the end of the month.  For those asking, this is for around 250 material handling equipment in warehouses throughout the US as well as around 500 rentals with a minimum of one year.  Margin in my industry is very low and in this deal, around 2% total for the purchases.  The sales rep receives 30% of that number and 1% of the total rental volume.  Rental margin is closer to 35%.  For myself‚Ä¶. I just started as the sales manager for four regions and have a salary and a small commission.  My cut would be $23,500, however helping close this would give me plenty of roof for negotiations next year.  Edit 2:  This is a very complex deal and would take pages of detail to update.  We were in the lead until the customer asked us to not charge any OT rates on equipment usage as apparently the other vendors have offered.  We had to raise rental rates by 20% to accommodate this and with the amount of equipment, that equates to $2M per year.  The numbers don‚Äôt make sense since this is a 3 shift   operation.  The details of the deal are poor at best from the customer (which is standard for them) and there is an extremely high chance of failure for the winner of this deal.  There was a power failure at one of the warehouses and we would have lost the deal if it wasn‚Äôt for this event as we presented the higher rates and a decision was to be made the next day.  This is now pushed to Wednesday and we could, if we wanted to, honor the original rates, but the complexity of the deal feels too uncertain to move forward.  The kicker is that the now leader is the company I just left.  It would be gratifying beating my chest as the winner, but after a lot of thought, and some whiskey, the smart move is letting the customer know they are going to be disappointed/devastated with the results of choosing that vendor, and that we‚Äôll be working behind the scenes to help them out when they inevitably will call us for help.  Sometimes passing on a deal that you know is inevitable to fail from your competitor is the best move in the long run.  This is the first time in my 20 year career I‚Äôve had this come so clear and it probably doesn‚Äôt happen in many other industry‚Äôs, but 4D chess when presented is the opportunity is the play."}

Most salespeople end their explanations by asking \"Does that make sense?\" This is a terrible question because it makes the prospect feel stupid if they say no, it gets automatic \"yes\" responses even when they're confused, it doesn't reveal their real concerns or objections and it kills momentum instead of advancing the conversation  When you ask \"What questions do you have about this?\" instead, you give them permission to ask clarifying questions, uncover objections you can address immediately, keep the conversation flowing naturally, position yourself as helpful instead of pushy and learn what aspects matter most to them  Example transformation:  Bad one - So our software automates your invoicing process and saves you about 10 hours per week. Does that make sense? Response Yeah, makes sense (conversation dies)  Good - so our software automates your invoicing process and saves you about 10 hours per week.

I‚Äôve done excellent in all prior sales roles (President Clubs, quarterly bonuses, the whole 9 yards).  I don‚Äôt even (potentially) qualify to receive unemployment benefits until the end of July.  Soooo. In this in-between time, I‚Äôve of course been throwing my resume like crazy. I also picked up some sales work for 2 different medical distributor companies as a contract worker, commission only. The first is selling amniotic skin grafts, the second is selling DVT & pain management devices.  I closed the deal on my first lunch ever for the skin graft company in May, so technically I have a client for that already, just need them to place some orders soon. The device company came with some existing clients that they‚Äôre slowly starting to introduce me to as of last week, which again, should hopefully start rolling in some orders here in the next month or so.  The ambiguity around this for me is frankly, I need income soon. Wasn‚Äôt expected to be laid off like I was, & it was difficult to ‚Äúsave up‚Äù for this timeframe, as the last few months of my employment was a combo of no sales + the initial draw getting paid back to them from my paychecks.  I‚Äôm struggling to decide on what to do because I really want to give this medical sales stuff a shot. I have zero interest in going back to a 9-5.  But at the same time, I‚Äôve gotten one job offer & expect to have another coming in soon, both for full-time W2 work. Accepting either opportunity would make it fairly difficult to grow my pipeline for the two medical sales jobs. As you can imagine, it‚Äôs difficult to turn down the consistent paycheck opportunities right now, despite my feelings towards it.  I‚Äôd love to hear y‚Äôall‚Äôs thoughts as to whether or not these medical sales opps seem worth going all in on & denying the W2 offers for.

I‚Äôm 3 months into the role and last month they announced that they are no longer considering internal hires for the AE positions.

I'm constantly trying to bridge customer needs (for bespoke engineering parts/materials) with what our R&D and Production teams can deliver. I'm also pushing for larger volume sales.  My engineering background helps, but the internal dynamic is consuming my time. Our R&D team is largely passive, often waiting for sales to hand-feed them projects. This seems to stem from a company culture that's overly technical and less commercially driven. Our CEO (who is very technical), for example, seems to heavily rely on our Head of R&D, almost to the point of avoiding decisions or comments without \"scientific validation.\"  The tough part is, I'm now partially doing my CEO's job, trying to keep our Head of R&D happy and guide their work. This means I can't go out and sell, can't prospect for new business, and it's severely impacting my core responsibilities. Meanwhile, our Production team is incredibly proactive and, frankly, frustrated by R&D's lack of drive. R&D's, passive attitude makes any engagement difficult, and frankly, nobody really wants to engage with them.  I'm genuinely curious: for my fellow sales pros (especially those in manufacturing facing similar organizational dysfunctions), how do you navigate a situation where you're effectively managing R&D, unable to focus on sales, and feeling stuck between a passive R&D and a frustrated Production?"}

Most sales reps think their job is to convince prospects to buy. It's not. Your job is to figure out if prospects are actually ready to buy.  Here's what's happening in probably 90% of B2B sales calls:  Prospect shows up to demo - Rep presents features - Prospect asks good questions - Rep thinks this is going well - Demo ends - Prospect says looks great, we'll discuss internally - Rep follows up for 3 weeks - Deal dies  Sound familiar?  The problem isn't your demo. The problem isn't your follow-up. The problem is you're letting prospects be polite instead of honest.  Most prospects will sit through your entire presentation even if they have zero intention of buying. Why? Because they're nice people and don't want to waste your time after you've already startedd  But here's the thing - they're actually wasting more of your time by not telling you the real situation.  There's one question that you can ask:  Based on what you've seen, is there anything that would prevent you from moving forward if the price was right?  Ask this right after your demo, before you talk pricing  Watch what happens:  Option 1: They give you a real objection  I'd need approval from my boss first  We're not implementing anything until Q3  I'm comparing 3 different solutions  Now you know what you're actually dealing with and can address it or move on.  Option 2: They realize they don't have a good reason to say no  Actually no, I don't think so  If the price makes sense, we could probably move pretty quickly  Boom. Real opportunity.  Option 3: They admit they're just shopping  We're still in early research phase  Just trying to understand what's out there\"  Perfect. Save everyone time and follow up in 6 months.  I started using this approach with clients about a year ago and close rates typically go up  The math is simple. If you're doing 100 qualified demos per month:    Before: 100 √ó 13% = 13 deals    After: 100 √ó 30% = 30 deals    That's 17 extra deals per month. Even at $5k average deal size, that's $85k in extra monthly revenue just from asking one uncomfortable question.  I hope you like it and can apply it in your business"}

I‚Äôve been managing those partner relationships and receive commission on everything the partners bring in.

I would then take the deals from there to close.    The majority of my time will be spent managing MSP relationships and supporting them with sales strategy and resources.

Doesn't matter if it's software, consulting, manufacturing, whatever  Great companies with better products and better prices losing deals to inferior competitors  Last month I'm talking to this founder and he goes \"I don't get it. We had the best proposal, best price, perfect fit. Customer went with competitor and their solution is garbage  So I ask \"When's the last time you talked to them before the RFP?\"  \"Uh maybe 6 months ago? When we finished their last project\"  There's your problem.  While he was radio silent for 6 months, the competitor was having coffee with the customer every month. Sending industry reports, making introductions and staying top of mind  When buying time came, guess who felt like the trusted partner?I see this constantly that companies think good work sells itself it doesn't.  The pattern is always to deliver great project,send final invoice and wonder why customer doesn't call them first  Meanwhile competitors are doing monthly check-ins not selling anything, just staying in touch,sharing relevant industry insights, making valuable introductions and being present when new needs emerge.Whenever i implement this approach with clients they see that increase in sales instantly.  The math is brutal it costs 5-10x more to acquire new customers than keep existing ones engaged. Yet everyone spends 90% of their time chasing new prospects.  Your best customers are also your competitors' best prospects. If you're not staying in their world, someone else will be.  I've watched companies lose $50K deals because a competitor sent better holiday cards not joking.  B2B buying is emotional, people buy from who they trust and remember. If you vanish after delivery, you become a vendor but if you stay engaged, you become a partner.  Hope it helps  P.S. Do you know what is interesting?

We wasted time calling companies that clearly didn‚Äôt need our service. I realized that a bad list doesn‚Äôt just waste time, it kills my chances.  I started creating free scored cold call lists for experiment, basically ranking potential customers by their quality as prospects to make cold calling more targeted. When I posted about it here, I got overwhelmed by the massive response. I managed to deliver one list manually, but checking every company website, researching job postings on LinkedIn, analyzing company size... I hit my limit and had to abandon it. Sorry to everyone who reached out.  It really hit me how desperately sales people (I'm in sales too) need quality lead lists.  A few months later, I rebuilt the process to be semi-automated and started again. The people who tried it found real value in the lists, which was encouraging.  Key discovery: You can create effective cold call lists without massive services like ZoomInfo.  Using just publicly available internet information, you can figure out if a company is advertising, hiring, interested in digital strategy, or focused on local connections. You can understand a company's direction and predict their pain points pretty accurately. With the right approach to internet research, individuals and small companies can do efficient sales too.

The first truth I try to say is to treat it like a game The second is that it is harassment. Some people will inevitably dislike you just for approaching them and disrupting whatever they are doing, but it's necessary part of the process.  You are there to harass people and some people will be unhappy. Don't take it too seriously."}

It feels braggy and I know many friends and family who might take it the wrong way.  But I went from averaging 150k-200k/mo in sales in 2024, to 250-285k in 2025. This month I hit 285k, my commission is 8% of revenue. Last year I did 1.9m and this year I am on track for 3m+.  I sell in the life science industry and my average sale is anywhere from 2-5k, with equipment being the outlier at 15-20k. Last year I saw the writing on the wall and stopped focusing on primarily Academia and pivoted to more lucrative industries that we haven't tapped but use the same supplies.  About 3 years ago I was on the verge of quitting sales until I found my new company.

From his opener I could tell we were actually in the same or similar industry. But then he asked if I was still at Company A. I told him I had never worked there and he said sorry he must have the wrong number and he hung up.  The thing is Company A is a competitor of my company. So he wasn‚Äôt far off. And he had me on the line. But he bailed at the first sign he had the wrong person. And he did, but maybe I was the right, wrong person.  Moral of the story.

I‚Äôm generally not a super positive person‚Ä¶ if anything I am fairly pessimistic and verbally critical of company specific processes and tools.

I was extremely tight on a few others and very critical of how they thought through customer interactions, our internal processes and how they are best fit to move forward with deals or customer questions.

Much of its really valid. So many lay-offs, a hiring boom, then a bust, tarrifs, economic craziness, people pinching pennies like crazy.  Those of us who have been around a few downturns have learned some important lessons that helped. I sold through the great recession, covid, and now. There are some very common threads through all of them.  Companies still have to run therefore they need stuff. You can't buy and sell without accounting software. How many amazon boxes did you see this week in your neighborhood? Box sales are doing okay. Companies need software, goods, services, etc etc etc. Still.  Companies and people WILL evaluate every dang dollar. Which means if your product helps save money, combines costs, or is super necessary, you can sell a lot. The idea of comparing costs, saving funds, and executing more efficiently will win.  Bad sellers will fail. Competitors will close. During the great recession, the company I was at saw 4 of our main competitors close. And we easily snagged all of that business, building a great long term core of income. There will be less people you will sell against in the next 12-18 months. So if you are good, you will win.  You have to change your income expectations. Just facts. Problem with this downturn is ALL OF US have already done that. But yeah, don't but a new car, don't book that giant vacation, put some money aside. For those of us who that aint an option... buckle up I guess.  This too shall pass. And the business relationships you form now will pay off. I got a few stories of customers who we helped grow during covid who wouldn't even consider a new vendor for a few years because of it.  The org you are working for REALLY matters. More than ever. A badly run org aint going to make it. This is the biggest issue right now due to PE and funding rounds. It is hard to tell what is a good org.  You may want to look for older and more established SMBs vs the big guys. SMBs tend to stick with their team longer and have some margin to play with (in general). An owner/operator is more willing to lose a few bucks short term to keep the business going for generations vs quarter to quarter.  Anyone else got some good old hat lessons?"}

I wanted to share some tips because I am in a leadership position and I interview candidates all the time. Here are a list of tips. If you all like this, I can expand on it. But I don't want to write a detailed post that either no one reads or everyone hates lol.    The name of the game is getting an interview. That is the hardest part. Early on in my career, I didn't have the experience to get interviews. So getting past HR was the hardest barrier to entry. I was great on zoom and can carry a conversation - but my resume SUCKED. You need to get past the hiring person and get on their calendar any means necessary. If you are applying to 30+ companies and getting NO ANSWER. You are the problem. You need to sit down and fix your resume. That is the cold hard truth. You should be constantly tweaking your resume. Use AI, use friends, use parents. This one bullet point can be an entire post and I can go into my details on this if you all want.    **Get creative -**Take risk. If an job asks to talk about your best winning deal, change the topic and talk about actually your biggest lost and what you learned. Be creative. Stand out. Take risk. It is not you competing against yourself. You are competing against 100+ applicants. Assume they all suck.    Stand out with AI - I am over 40. I know AI but I would grade myself a B-. When I interview young people and they know less about chatgpt than I do, that is a red flag. That is honestly the reality of the situation. If you can't explain the difference between Claude, Gemini and Chatgpt and know the strengths of each - you are DOA. If you are not articulating how you are using AI in your personal life (therapy, resume building) etc. You are DOA. VPS love hearing about AI adoption. It doesn't matter your personal opinion on the matter.    Remember it is all theatre - As you get more and more higher up in your career, you will start to realize people just want to be heard and they don't really care about the solution. Everything becomes theatre. Get really good at acting and reacting.    Be able to diagnose the problem - Get really good at finding the real problem and that the solution becomes very obvious. Speaking to this type of mentality is what leadership people love    ASK ABOUT OBJECTIONS - Here is a killer line. When there is about 10 minutes left say \"Hey I know we have about 10 minutes left, are their any red flags I can address now while we have time left\"    TRIAL CLOSE - Show your swagger. Ask them why they wouldn't hire you now. Understand their process    Ask REAL questions - DO NOT ASK ABOUT THE PRODUCT. I hate when interviewees do this. You will learn about the product during onboarding. The recruiter is the best person to ask those questions and suss out. Ask more detailed questions like \"Do we have PMF\" \"What is our CL rate\" etc.    I know it is tough out there. But you have no idea how many people fumble up their interviews. You are in sales, this should be your chance to shine. I can add more tips here if people want but I want to express things that people know but are too afraid to admit."}

Mostly I asked for encouragement, and y‚Äôall delivered and were encouraging, which I appreciate.  I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôm gainfully employed again. I supplemented my income part-time working at a Shell gas station and convenience store to at least minimize the impact on my savings (which I was doing anyway even with the previous job because retail management isn‚Äôt exactly high-paying unless you‚Äôre in a big-box store or a high-volume small-box). Either way, while it‚Äôs somewhat of a pay cut, I‚Äôm working again in a sales management position at a destination location with a different company.  I‚Äôll still follow and maybe ask in the future how I might still make the leap to the desired sales role I seek, but now I have breathing room.

I've been with my company for five years.  For the first two, I was the top SDR and blew them away with shit I learned from this sub.  After that, they promoted me to AE for about three months, then asked me to build and lead a team. I was completely off the phones.  It was my first leadership role ever. I was young, only 24 at the time, and now at 26, I can see how much I had to learn. I think being that young made it hard for my CEO and other department heads to really take my input seriously. Looking back, I think that actually held the company back in some ways.  Over the past two years, I hired and let go of 12 reps. No one quit, and no one left because they wanted to. The company just wasn‚Äôt setting them up to win. I put a lot of focus into skill development, and I really wanted everyone who worked with me to be able to look back and say they grew here. When I had to let people go, almost all of them understood and appreciated the experience.  Our first year as a team under my leadership, we crushed it. Hit quota, high energy, good results. But the second year, our numbers dropped fast. We only generated about a quarter of what we did the year before. The wild part is that the original sales team stayed the same, we just hired more outbound reps. What changed? Marketing. We‚Äôre now on our third CMO, and the new team just hasn‚Äôt figured out how to bring in leads we can actually sell.  Today, the CEO asked me to let go of our last two SDRs and go back to my old SDR role. I‚Äôll keep my $80K base and probably still OTE around $130K, but I still feel like shit and felt like I failed.  Now it's just me the original SDR, and our original AE.  I‚Äôve worked hard over the past two years. I‚Äôve read books, joined masterminds, taken trainings, and tried to grow into the kind of leader people respect. I feel like I really gave it everything. So yeah, it stings a bit. It‚Äôs also a little freeing to not be responsible for a whole department anymore. Still, I really enjoyed leading a team and seeing people grow. Plus the skills I learned along the way that weren't \"sales\" was extremely valuable.  Anyway, back to the phones for now. Thanks fellas, hope you guys are crushing it!"}

I‚Äôm trying to break into a B2B quota-carrying sales role. I‚Äôve been around the function in strategy and operations roles for years, and after spending time as chief of staff to a CRO, I knew I wanted to be the one actually driving revenue.  Here‚Äôs a quick overview of my background:  M7 MBA  Chief of Staff to the CRO at a ~$150M ARR software company ‚Äì managed a $300M pipeline, ran weekly sales performance reviews, built sales comp plans, and designed Tableau dashboards to track team KPIs. Played a big role in improving NRR from ~80% to ~100%.  Two-time startup founder ‚Äì I ran all sales myself. Cold outreach, demos, closing deals, mostly with state/local campaigns for an AI-driven political tool. Nothing huge, but real money and real buyers.  Top-tier consulting firm ‚Äì led sales process redesigns, pricing strategies, and GTM transformations for Fortune 500 clients. One $6B B2B client saw a ~15% YoY lift in recurring revenue after implementing our new motion.  Private equity analyst ‚Äì ~60% of my time was outbound calls to software execs, trying to get them interested in strategic partnerships or exits. It was SDR work, just a different pitch.  I‚Äôve done training, understand the metrics and tools (Salesforce, Outreach, etc.), and feel comfortable in the room. But I haven‚Äôt officially carried a number, and I‚Äôm trying to change that.  So if you‚Äôve made this jump‚Äîwhat worked for you?  Should I aim for SMB AE roles? Should I lean into RevOps again and try to convert internally? If someone with my background were applying to a role on your team, how would they make a strong case?  Open to any and all advice. Appreciate it in advance. If relevant, I'm based in Austin."}

So I'll leave it out as much as possible when it comes to that.  But I'll just say, I work in an industry that is VERY affected by our current political climate.   And this is leading to buyers being extremely wary of spending money right now.  Unfortunately, my company seems to not be willing to acknowledge this.  I mean they will acknowlege it generally, but not when it comes to quotas and stuff.   For example, this quarter, I don't think any of our sales people will be hitting their goal.  But their mantra seems to just be \"make more calls\", like we can just invent money for these buyers to have.   And they seem to just be focusing on \"making it up next quarter\", when I just don't see that happening.  And it's frustrating for me to, every day recently, have those deals I thought were a go, to come back and say they either can't buy, can't buy now, or have to cut their order.  But its more frustrating just feeling like my job is on the line because of all these things that aren't in my control.  I guess this is part a vent, and part asking how others are dealing with this."}

Hes costed us two sales so far with his leaving stuff and dirtying up the vehicles one of which would've been huge.

This week I decided to go with the nuclear option and filed for a tribunal. I have plenty if evidence to win and then some. However, I don't want this to drag for months. So, whilst waiting for an ACAS certificate that I can use to file the tribunal case I decided to inform the company I was at that I was going to go nuclear and they needed to pay me.  At first they asked how much wanted to get paid, and this is where it get's complicated. The company I was working for had hired me from a different company. So I worked for company A, but my contract was with company B. Before starting with company A I was promised commission, I have screenshots of proof that they made that commitment. However, company A never formalised our commission structure and even though I kept pressing about it they terminated me before I got something on paper. Given that company B was supposed to mediate this I asked them to share my metrics so we could negotiate a percentage and move on with our lives like a month ago. They never did, and basically said make up a number that would satisfy you.  Before I for terminated I made note of some of the work I had done but not everything, so knowing that the biggest deal I brought in was 4500 pounds I figured let me settle on 13500 pounds and we can use that as a starting point for negotiation. They countered with 500 pounds and I would sign a form that said they were in no way liable. I turned them down, I have such a solid case for tribunal that I'll make well over 13500 when it comes down to it. The only thing is I am in desperate need of cash. I gave them a 5pm deadline today, and when it passed, I told them the offer was off the table and that I was now going to pursue this legally.  I can feel this situation draining me, my back hurts like you wouldn't believe I'm barely sleeping and I'm always anxious. But I've gotta see this through. They screwed me so hard even though I was the highest performer and great at my job. A part of me wishes I had settles for that 500 but had I done that I know I would have regretted it till the day I die. Here's hoping they change their mind last minute, but if not, I'll at least know that by the time this is all through, how ever many months down the line, I'll be rolling in cash"}

The close-the-loop philosophy turns you into another piece of mental load that I need to manage.  If you are on the approved vendor list you'll be on the bidder list unless you've actively pissed off me or another key stakeholder.  If you lost  the RFP it was because you scored lower on the weighted scorecard.  If you are competing in a private sector, competitive bidding environment, this is my best advice:    Read the RFP and SOW front to back.  Don't skim it for highlights.  You competitor who noticed that we asked for a specific detail in the SOW that you didn't notice might score higher than you on \"understanding of scope\" or \"quality of bid package\".    When you read the package take note of every document requested as part of the package.  I've had otherwise good bidders lose close races because they didn't include their quality manual or their ED&I statement.    It doesn't matter if we've done business before a hundred times, include every requested component to the bid package.  Even if I saw it from you on a separate bid yesterday.  Different stakeholders attend different bid evaluations and every bid should stand on its own.  Complacency kills on this one.    Asking insightful clarification questions during the clarification window wins you credibility.  If your clarification questions can be answered by copy and paste out of the SOW or RFP document, you lose credibility.  Leverage AI or a support person to validate if your clarification is already answered in the provided documents before submitting it.    I've worked in organizations where procurement will ask bidders to sharpen their pencil and I have worked in \"the price is the price\" environments.  Your best bet in formal RFP competition is giving your actual best price up front.  In a very close race, a 0.1% difference in price has won a bid evaluation that I ran.  I'd never fault a bidder for saying \"We gave you our best price\" but if you didn't give it in the first place then you might not get the chance to do better.    Appearance of improper behavior is roughly as bad as improper behavior.  Typically the instructions will be all communication goes through procurement.  When that's the case, don't talk to me or the nonprocurement members of my team directly while the RFP is open.  You are risking pissing off key stakeholders and losing your spot in future bids.  Yes you can potentially get an edge but the edge is not worth the long run loss unless you are looking for a one off deal.    And a couple of points beyond the bidding process:  7. The time for high value relationship building is when we are actively working together.  Impress my stakeholders with your industry knowledge and solutions when you show up a few minutes early for meetings or when you have someone walking down a job with you or when you are asking insightful questions at the kick off meeting.  This will bank you some goodwill and maybe a stakeholder champion.  8. Take ownership of follow through.  My absolute pet peeve is a disconnect between sales and production/operations.  If you agreed to something unusual to meet site requirements and you throw it over the fence and walk away as soon as the PO is cut, odds are really good that I have to fight with your organisation to get my needs met and I will exclude you from future bids.  A current example is, in my province anyone working in any way at a mine site has to have a specific mine safety course.  Sales guy knew, construction coordinator didn't while arranging subcontractors.  That turned into a me problem that I didn't appreciate.  I know that private sector formal competitive RFP isn't the sales landscape for the majority here but hopefully this provides some insight for someone."}

I‚Äôve been in direct sales for 7 years. For the last 3, I was the assistant manager (basically 2nd in command) and about 6 months ago I was promoted to run my own territory, managing a team of 15 reps.  Around the same time, my wife and I had our second kid, and the combination of new responsibilities at work and at home has been a lot to juggle. I‚Äôve always been a top performer, usually leading the board, but lately I‚Äôve slipped to the middle of the pack.  We have a minimum quota I‚Äôm expected to hit, and I‚Äôve fallen short the last couple months. Leadership has been checking in frequently, reminding me that my numbers are an issue. I know I‚Äôm capable of way more, but I‚Äôm in a rut I can‚Äôt seem to shake. Generating revenue just feels harder than it used to.  For anyone who‚Äôs been in a similar spot - especially in leadership - how did you turn it around? Any mindset shifts, routines, or tactics that helped you reset and get back to top form?  Appreciate any advice."}

So I decided to build 4 different sales bots using CustomGPTs (same instructions prompt) to test different methodologies.  They are as follows‚Ä¶  Bot numero Uno: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get Real or Let‚Äôs Not Play‚Äù + ‚ÄúThe Truth Detector‚Äù    Based on Mahan Khalsa and Jack Schaefer‚Äôs teachings    Consultative style with advanced BANT (Budget, Authority, Needs, Timing) + FBI-style Elicitation Techniques    Bot numero Dos: NEPQ Black Book + Jeremy Miner transcripts    ~20-30 video transcripts from Jeremy‚Äôs content    Psychologist-style questioning approach    Bot numero Tres: ‚ÄúNever Split the Difference‚Äù + NEPQ    Combined negotiation tactics with questioning frameworks    Tried to fill gaps in consequent questioning    Bot numero Quattro: Brian Choi    Transcribed his 8-9 hour YouTube course    Plus multiple live training sessions    My Rankings (Best to Worst):  ü•á Winner: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Get Real‚Äù + ‚ÄúTruth Detector‚Äù    Helped me close my biggest sale yet ($6,000)    High authority questioning while also being a little intimidating    Consultative rather than pushy    Works great for legitimate prospects    ü•à 2nd Place: Brian Choi    More blunt and consultative    ‚ÄúBe successful bro‚Äù style questioning    Great for re-engaging ghosted prospects, interestingly    Speaks like an actual human (not Jeremy)    ü•â 3rd Place: NEPQ + Jeremy Miner    Good for lower-value clients    Works well in crypto/stock offers (FOMO-based)    Takes too long for high-value clients    Too focused on emotional manipulation    üóëÔ∏è Last Place: Never Split the Difference + NEPQ    Makes people feel like idiots    Sounds way too slick and facetious    ‚ÄúSeems like you‚Äôre struggling with this, is that fair to say?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ No shit Sherlock.    So, for me, Never Split the Difference sounds great in theory but comes across as too ‚Äúslick‚Äù in practice.  Jeremy Miner‚Äôs style works if your clients don‚Äôt know how to wipe their butt, but fails with 90IQ+ prospects.  Brian Choi actually excels at prospect re-engagement specifically. I guess his long-form course was focused on lead-gen, so it covered a lot of that.  And Let‚Äôs Get Real x Truth Detector is just really good for cutting through the BS during a consultation, but it‚Äôs a little weak for objection handling (Mahan disqualifies too quickly). DISCLAIMER I‚Äôm not sharing the bots (they‚Äôre private and staying that way, this isn‚Äôt a scarcity pitch, please don‚Äôt ask for access).  BUT‚Ä¶  If you want to see how any of them would handle a specific objection or situation, drop it in the comments. I‚Äôll run it through whichever bot you‚Äôre curious about.  This has been a fun project for me after work hours, and I figured the results might help others who are struggling with the ‚Äúbut I got nobody to train with‚Äù thing."}

Instead, share the high-level theme of what the idea could be, then pause, and bring your backers into the discussion\" *  This is precisely what a senior negotiator (political+business) told me a few years ago. Your presentation does not have to be written in stone. Instead of just listening to the feedback from the room, he used to read the body language of the room and change his pitch accordingly. People who hired him thought he was crazy changing horses mid-stream, but his batting average was unbelievable.  Now you might be thinking, \"Well, if you did your discovery well enough, there would be no need to change your presentation\". Well, in theory yes. In reality, sometimes you will meet DMs in the boardroom who seem to be on a different planet compared to the DM you spoke to initially. So, this technique could come in very useful.

Maybe I‚Äôm forgetting how bad it sucks to NOT make good money, or taking it for granted or whatever. My work life balance is better and I‚Äôm not reclused from PTSD anymore but I still feel disconnected from the regular working world, my coworkers and clients, and generally not interested in what I do I just like the money.  TLDR: not happy despite making 3x as much as I used to- advice? Anyone feel the same? Anyone felt like this at one sales job then jumped to a new industry and liked it? Again, I think I‚Äôd really enjoy law enforcement or med dev sales but it‚Äôs so competitive.  Hope you‚Äôre all having a day of terrible leads and useless cold calling thanks for reading."}

Asking for suggestions  Geographical IS hardware AE here, had a rep at my job snake a deal out of a account today. My parent account had multiple subsidiaries that all merged into the parent entity. This happened over two years ago and back in February (calling him  Mo) Mo calls me telling me that his contracts with his subsidiary are  ‚Äúsupposed to be running through my entity for now on‚Äù.. Goes on to say that I can have the account and it can all go through me. So I requested the account and nothing happened. Fast forward to today and I have a CBR with my main contact at the parent entity, who I have a great relationship with. He goes on to tell me there is some equipment they need at their ‚Äúother location that he knows has worked with us in the past.‚Äù Then I look in our CRM and I see that the the other rep is running the deal that my main contact just mentioned. Then all hell broke loose‚Ä¶.  I made a bad decision and contacted the procurement contact and supervisor that Mo was dealing with and said ‚Äú i can reduce the cost on your current pricing‚Äùhave worked with both of these individuals numerous times. They did not get back to me and my manager saw the email. Then my manager got pissed at me and made me send a ‚Äúdisregard message‚Äù: ‚ÄúI apologize for the mistake, you are already receiving the best pricing‚Äù. My manager got really pissed at me for sending the messaging and said this is a really bad look.  The supervisor and procurement contacy actually know me well but after reviewing with my main contact at my parent entity, he confirms that the order for this deal would be coming out of his budget and he just found out. This essentially means that the order is issued by the parent and we have a strict rule at my org that orders coming from a originating HQ address go to the rep that oversees that location and the account(which I did in this scenario). Mo is in his 40s and I am in my mid 20s. This guy definitely knew what he was doing.  with all that said, I am just trying to get feedback on how to make sure I can avoid these situations and go about it in a better manner in the future."}

Straight after school I got into sales (tech and tele) before moving into a retail store all whilst studying High-school teaching. From there I got into working for a bank before being poached to work for a Cyber Security distributor across Asia-Pac as an Account Manager / Inside Sales Rep.  After 2 successful years here i was poached again, but heres were things went downhill. The offer on the table was everything I was after, however after a few months when the company wasn't performing as they expected, my job role and expectations completely changed. My new responsibilities were completely out of my skillset, something I disclosed heavily throughout my interview process. This shifted goal-post left me feeling hopeless, my probation period was extended out (even though I had already passed) and I was being pushed out of the company. Ultimately my employment ended in Sep 2024. I got into a different industry in the meantime to take a break but now I'm struggling to get back into sales.  I should note that I did not complete my studies as I was required to get the Covid vaccine which i opted not to do (please don't comment on this, I'm not here to argue my medical decisions) and was subsequently removed from my university degree.  My confidence has taken a big hit (like really big) and I'm considering getting back in at the bottom and working my way up again from SDR to AM. On the other hand, I have an opportunity to go back to complete my degree, however wouldn't be looking at full-time employment until 2027 earliest which is not ideal.  I have been applying to many jobs over the last 6 months, few interviews but none have gone anywhere.  When it comes to Account Management I know I'm excellent at this based on customer reviews and internal reviews from previous management, as well as managing the accounts of other staff members whilst they were on leave and gaining glowing reviews on their return. My struggles within sales are finding new business as a BDM, as I don't have a lot of experience in prospecting and finding new leads. My experience was all channel distribution and I mainly managed existing accounts.  I'm just so lost on how to proceed and get back into sales, it feels like I'm staring into a black hole and can't get out.  Any advice is appreciated."}

Or should we all prepare to build large following on instagram and Linkedin in order to pitch our products?"}

Furthermore, there is currently no mid market team and our product is a poor fit for the mid-market.  The chance  of realistic success is low but I would get the coveted AE title change.  Option 2) Offered the founding GTM role at a seed startup.  The role will be to build outbound from scratch but still no closing.  Currently there are no customers and not even a fully developed product.  Some more info.  ‚Ä¢ Founding team has one successful exit under their belt  ‚Ä¢ received a very large seed round with great investors  ‚Ä¢ Realistic plan for GTM (no grand plans of displacing entrenched systems at Microsoft)  ‚Ä¢ will work directly with CEO.

I've been with them for 3 weeks now and have been enjoying it for the most part, but pay isn't exactly incredible and breaking over 6 figures is literally not possible on this comp plan. Not atypical of this specific job in this industry, but definitely not my favorite part about it.

That being said, I just received an offer letter with a financial investment company that has the same base but with an incredibly lucrative pay plan doing essentially nothing but cold calling leads generated by a marketing team. They have a phenomenal reputation for their reps making an immense amount of money and 6-8 years down the line, promoting into a role where $1m a year is actually on the low end of the average pay. It's just an absolute churn and burn grind house. They also only work 8 hours a day and rarely ever have an opportunity for overtime.  What would you do?

Our team consists of:    1 Sales person    1 L6 (KAM) with a dedicated L4 (male) supporting them    1 L3 (newly joined) who has been given a large number of accounts from a previous L5, which seems like a huge responsibility for someone so new    1 L4 (me) with a growing base (2x growth in 2 months)    Recently, my boss asked the L4 female (who joined around the same time as the L3) to be tagged to my accounts, citing no clear reason. This L4 can't report to me as we're at the same level. I'm concerned about role overlap and lack of clarity.  He had asked me to involve her in my accounts till the time a new L3 joins my team so I reluctantly involved her in 2/10 accounts last week. Today he asked me to involve her in all accounts before Friday.  She was hired for a whale üê≥ account to be handled by the L6 but that's delayed by a couple months so as of now there's more mouths to feed than the food available.  I'm finding it weird as to how I'll work with her when she won't even report to me or have a dotted line reporting.  I don't like gray areas so I need help to ask targeted questions to seek clarity.  What's even more puzzling is that the L3 has been handed over a large number of accounts, which seems like a massive workload. I'm not sure if this is a normal practice as he's clearly over worked.  My boss wants introductions done before a review with our super boss, who's aware of the situation. I think my boss is trying to justify the L4's role by moving them to my base as the L6 already has one L4.  Questions:    How should I approach this situation?    What questions should I ask my boss for clarity?    How can I ensure a smooth transition while maintaining my responsibilities?    Goal: I want to understand the reasoning behind this change and find a way to work effectively with the new team structure.  Any advice or insights from veterans would be greatly appreciated!"}

I‚Äôm looking for help with the compensation package.  Here‚Äôs the short story:    I have 0 years of Director experience and understandably think that should affect Base Salary.    Pay plan information is hard to come by at this company. Full salary, or salary with a percentage of profit being the two most frequent options. Something like $140-165k 2-3% of net profit.    My boss is open to sitting and constructing a pay plan.    I won‚Äôt receive a bonus for this year even if we make the changes next month. So I basically won‚Äôt receive one until March of 2027, for the 2026 year.    I‚Äôm currently making $70k salary, $140k-$160k OTE.    This is a plan I think that is fair to both parties.  Let me know where this compensation package is on a scale from bad to amazing.  Salary: $130,000  Bonus: 2% of net profit based off 2025 metrics, 3% of all dollars over the profit goal.  Example:  Based off 2025 sales being $10,500,000 @ 28% net margin, profit would be $2,940,000.  Subtracting the sales reps hurdles would equal $1,680,000 in profit.  $1,680,000 would be the bench mark used for the following years bonus structure.  2% would be paid up to $1,680,000 with 3% being paid on all profit above.  Based off an 80% attainment of $14,800,000 @ 32% net margin, profit would be $4,736,000.  We can calculate the bonus using the following metrics:  -2026 Profit: $4,736,000 -Hurdle: 1,260,000 2026 Post Hurdle Profit: $3,476,000 2025 Benchmark: $1,680,000 2026 Growth: $1,796,000  2% of $1,680,000 for $33,600 3% of $1,796,000 for $53,880  I would like my profit benchmark to stay $1,680,000 of which I would be paid 2%, then every year forward be paid 3% of all growth past that."}

Been interested in sales since my position at a refinancing company cold calling leads day in and day out having to set a minimum of 10 appts a day. Back then I was a timid, insecure, shy kid who was way too nice and always backed down and failed at any rebuttal.  Since then I‚Äôve been through a lot in life, have gotten really good at small talk with strangers, much easier for me to make friends now, people always say I‚Äôm a great listener and very good at allowing an engaging conversation because I feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù. Always complimented on my trustworthiness.  I started a role last month at a home improvement company doing the same thing again, cold calling day in and day out trying to set at least 2-3 appts a day. It‚Äôs much easier for me now. Everyone at work says they‚Äôre very impressed with how professional and friendly I am to prospects. Obviously it‚Äôs a grind but I do tend to find those prospects who take a liking to my kindness and social manners. Here‚Äôs the issue: I hate cold calling, especially with a product these people do not need, I greatly struggle to create urgency.  My mother was a regional sales manager and she was fantastic at her job. I remember asking her and she told me it was all based off the genuine relationships she built with her customers. These were repeated customers year in and year out because my mom really knew how to build relationships.  TL:DR: how do I figure out what path to take in this field if I want to be like my mother? I want to build relationships and foster repeat business, and since I‚Äôm so fresh I really don‚Äôt know what route to pursue. Thank you."}

Well, I did just that and all of last week juggled both full time jobs leaving me completely overwhelmed and exhausted. I emailed my sales job today and told them I was stepping down. My boss called me and offered me a different position as a ‚Äúcustomer success manager‚Äù. I would no longer be cold calling or canvassing, but be calling on existing clients, making sure they are happy and working with them with upgrades and making sure everything is running smoothly. I‚Äôm not sure if this position comes with a raise yet, we are supposed to talk tomorrow about details. The restaurant job is paying me 70k plus covering my full benefits, but hours kind of suck. In my new role I would be a liaison between sales and the tech guys. I am going to hear my old boss tomorrow but have any of you folks transitioned into this kind of role? What kind of comp plan do these positions offer? I‚Äôve only been in sales for a year and all of my experience is in the hospitality industry. My sales job is restaurant tech so we deal with restaurants so that‚Äôs where my experience comes from.  What do you guys think?"}

For context I sell a solution to IT departments, last year I closed over 1.3M USD but my average deal size is around 20K because all the small upgrades bring the average size down and transaction count up.  So when I interview for Ent roles they instantly think I am some transactional rep even though I have deals from 5k-250K last year and lots of 30-80k deals which make up the majority of my quota. Sales cycle is 6 months plus.  I do not engage with anyone more senior than IT director level or head of IT infrastructure at smaller companies which is also another red flag when I interview for these roles. I mainly sell to companies which do more than 500m per year in revenue and public sector. Its a point solution rather than a complex platform play.  It's almost like I am stuck in some pseudo mid market/ent/pub sec role with no way to progress into real ent. Im pretty much capped out at 200K-250K OTE in my current role and when I hear stories in Ent of people banking 500K+ in good years I feel like I am wasting my potential even though they have lower quotas than me.  How did you do it? I am talking about top tier tech orgs like Palo, Crowdstrike, Snowflake, Rubrik, Databricks, Elastic, Dynatrace etc."}

This would be the largest win my company has had in about 5 years. After my boss left (director of sales), I have been the one taking these sales meetings.

I‚Äôve natured this account, flew to their facilities, shook hands, and have taken this product to launch. I fully believe that this deal was 100% me.

One of the bitchers from the group text reached out to the CEO to ‚Äútalk‚Äù about things. (Our CRO was let go so now our boss reports to CEO.) The teammate posted in the group chat (feigning bravery) that he was going to call the CEO to talk (I didn‚Äôt acknowledge). then he called me after the talk to let me know that he aired his grievances about our boss and that the CEO was open to hearing this and that the CEO was going to reach out to all of us and I should be comfortable talking about anything including the boss.

Building deck/story for a panel interview for a Strategic Account Director role in software and part of it will involve a 10-minutes on how I‚Äôd get up to speed quickly and effectively.  The role is complex; leading internal account activity across a group of other brand sellers while coordinating with marketing, product, and technical teams etc in a broader cross-functional environment (think big tech and cloud), all to sell into a couple strategic accounts in a regulated industry who will most likely, have various kinds of existing install base, incl on prem legacy. A big part of the role will be acting as the main voice inside the account(s), while coordinating across functions. A bit of a gatekeeper if you will just to align messaging / approach.  I‚Äôve got my own approach. For example: dig into the data / tools (pipeline, renewals, install base, whitespace), map key stakeholders - both internally and externally, get as much of a handover as reasonable from the predecessor and wider account team, and engage / collaborate with the broader team of sellers from day one etc. and of course, get out and in front of customer for relationship building / disco.  But I‚Äôd really value your input:What are key points you'd bring to the panel to show how you'd ramp up quickly in first month(s) to build trust/leadership (internally & externally); build (or continue) momentum, create pipeline and set the tone in a strategic account?

I‚Äôm in a tough spot and could use some outside perspective. (TLDR below, I know this is a read but I appreciate the expertise you all bring.)  Background: I‚Äôve spent 6 years in customer experience/sales (5 B2C, 1 B2B, used salesforce, apollo, and other similar tools) and content marketing (6 years as well, SEO/Content Writing focus). I am a 28M on the east coast. Despite living in a high-cost-of-living area, I‚Äôve never broken $75K, and in marketing, have gone through four different layoffs so far, most recently after the surge of ChatGPT. I recently started working weekends just to get by (HCOL, plus I like to hustle). I‚Äôve grown frustrated with marketing ‚Äî layoffs, low ceilings, AI taking over creative work (I used to love writing), and a general sense of burnout. As I‚Äôve grown older, I‚Äôm now much more money-motivated, fueling the career change idea as well.  I decided months ago to pivot into sales, especially since I miss client interaction and think my people skills are underutilized. I went through 8 rounds of interviews with a big-name payroll company, but got rejected for lack of closing experience, however received very positive feedback overall. So I refocused on SDR roles.  Pivot: Within a month, I landed several interviews, one for an Enterprise SDR offer at a global cloud IT firm which is also a great fit culturally. Crushed the interview, mock cold call, and even negotiated the base from $60K to $70K (OTE up to $90K). Quota attainment is reportedly 75%+ per Repvue and internal leadership. Product fits well, big logos (think large financial firms, aviation companies).¬† I was proud of myself and excited to finally make a leap into something more performance-based ‚Äì I felt a lot of respect for myself too, for making the switch, learning application/interview tips, and executing the plan correctly. I haven‚Äôt felt that same feeling of pride working in content marketing for years now.  Here‚Äôs the twist. The¬†same day¬†I got the SDR offer, my marketing job countered with a $90K promotion (no bonus/stock). Fuck me. It‚Äôs tempting: I could quit my weekend gig, stay in a stable role, and stop worrying about finances. But I hate the work. I‚Äôve been pigeon-holed into managing our video creation (I am not a video editor/producer nor want to be one). I feel stagnant, uninspired, and honestly don‚Äôt want to spend another year chasing SEO KPIs or recording TikToks. I worry about my long-term career in marketing given my discouragement to pursue it. With the advent of AI, marketing jobs are also in a smaller-supply now, and higher salaries are tough to get given the job competition increase within the industry. Once again, what nags on me is that I don‚Äôt feel a lot of self-respect in the industry, I am an ambitious individual and feel like I want to take a bet on myself in a different position.  The SDR role is a risk. If I don‚Äôt hit 100% quota (which I will be safe and say isn‚Äôt happening), I will earn less than I do now. It‚Äôll be harder, I fully understand and have done my due diligence, but also potentially more rewarding long-term. I like the idea of owning my impact and escaping the ‚Äúmarketing gets cut first‚Äù cycle ‚Äì but I know that poor performing salespeople also get the axe. I also don‚Äôt want to look back and regret leaving a guaranteed $90K when I‚Äôve been hustling for years just to get there. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù in a career that I don‚Äôt see a future for. I don‚Äôt expect to be one of the guys making 300k, but the prospect of possibly reaching 150k is very appealing to me. Reaching that milestone in my current marketing path almost feels impossible given that I work in a niche sector of marketing, and don‚Äôt have the desire to become a creative video producer/editor. I hardly even use social media personally (just LinkedIn and IG), and dislike the idea of needing to be on-top of social trends etc. I just don‚Äôt care, whereas others do, and are more likely to go further in marketing. All-in-all, working 7 days a week is starting to really take its toll on me, and I would love to go all-in on my actual career, which is why the sales restart prospect excited me.  For once, I am really trying to plan for the long-term, and I still believe in my heart that working with clients ‚Äì even if it‚Äôs not in a ‚Äúclosing‚Äù role, will excite me just a tad bit more.  ****TL;DR:****Just got a $90K promo in content marketing (stable but boring and burnout, layoff heavy). Also got a $70K base / $90K OTE Enterprise SDR offer at a company I love, but it‚Äôs a grind and riskier. Tired of marketing, excited by sales, but afraid of making a financially dumb decision.  What would you do?"}

I have started another company in the SAAS space in January, have landed a couple large contracts and some small subscription customs. Total revenue this year is 100k ish.  We have people booking demos but our close rate is about 22%. I don‚Äôt like that, I believe it should be a lot higher. The software we built can be used by most businesses, and it would replace a current system that these businesses already have. The issue is, I am struggling to create a great close and ‚Äúurgency‚Äù for potential customers to be engaged and sign up. Everyone wants to talk to their team about and get back to us.  The other issue is, in some cases this SaaS would replace personal on teams. So they would at some point let go of current employees. Which if it‚Äôs a manager for the company I think they get concerned about paying for a software that could replace or limit the need for a team member that they like.  Ultimately, selling SaaS is kicking my ass. I feel like I am shooting a shotgun shell in the air and hoping to hit something.  SaaS folks, please educate me!"}

In my last job, one of my managers just didn‚Äôt like me. There was never a reason that I got to know. I was always hitting target, my clients liked me, the other management liked me. This guy constantly tried finding fault with my work with the most trivial of issues. Like my e-mail signature not being written in the right font.  He also was a part of the clique of salespeople that worked out of his office where as I and two other salespeople were always the outcasts; never invited to conferences, trade-shows, outside work events etc.  It got so bad that I went to HR on him because he was starting to give my clients to other salespeople without telling me why.  Two weeks ago, he fired me and I still don‚Äôt know why. I was never on a PIP; as far as I knew my clients were satisfied, I had some large exciting projects in the pipeline, I was about to land a $500,000 project and had just quoted the customer who was all set to go.

I've been unemployed since December. I've had 4 interviews with this company, the last two were with a panel of 4 people. The last one I had to prepare was a 40-minute presentation role-play as a commercial cleaning company meeting with a multi-location hotel. (The job is for HVAC maintenance contracts) It went incredibly well, and it seems like I'm their number 1 pick.  The problem is the last step. It's a personality test, they send a personality test with a bunch of questions. Then you meet with a psychiatrist for 90 minutes. The company running this is called Corporate Psychologists. I'm fine with the written part. But a zoom 90-minute meeting with a psychiatrist seems incredibly excessive and invasive. I really want to tell them I'm not interested if that's part of the process. But I really need a job. I'm so discouraged.  I've been in SaaS for the last 7 years. I've been learning about both industries and preparing for these interviews. I spent SO MANY HOURS working on this. Especially with the presentation last week.  I've been in sales for years and I can't think of a single time I interviewed and didn't get the job. Things are so rough now I rarely get replies to applications and I've gotten to the end a couple of other times. But I don't have enterprise closing experience, and even though I was in a closing role for 14 years and a top performer, I've been in the sdr space for the last 5 years and that's all they seem to look at.

I‚Äôve been in the residential construction industry for about 4.5 years, with the last 2.5 years as a full-time salesman. I currently work for a very small general contractor that specializes in residential backyard remodeling (B2C). Our projects range from $2,000 to $150,000, though most fall between $20,000 and $50,000.  While my title is technically ‚Äúsalesman,‚Äù I also design and manage every project I sell. My hours are generally 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. I‚Äôve only worked a handful of weekends, though like most jobs, some days start earlier or end later depending on the workload.  A typical day includes:    Visiting one potential customer per day for an estimate    Checking in on current projects    Talking to existing clients    Office work (HOA/city permit applications, estimates, construction drawings, scheduling trades, etc.)    I drive anywhere from 50 to 150 miles daily‚Äîaround 15,000 work miles per year.  As I mentioned, it‚Äôs a small company with a $2M annual sales goal. There are two of us doing sales‚Äîmyself and the owner. The owner consistently brings in over $1M in sales annually. Here are my numbers so far:    2023:¬†$800,000    2024:¬†$450,000    2025 (projected):¬†$500,000    All leads are given to me‚Äîno cold calling. My compensation is 100% commission at 10% of the total sale. I receive no company truck, benefits, fuel card, monthly vehicle allowance, or fuel reimbursement. I'm a 1099 contractor and write off all my work-related expenses. Occasional bonuses range from $1,000 to $2,000. From what I‚Äôve been told, the owner operates under the same structure.  I‚Äôm just trying to get a feel for what compensation packages look like for others in similar sales roles. I‚Äôll admit‚Äîit‚Äôs possible I‚Äôm a mediocre salesman. It‚Äôs discouraging that my best sales year was my first. That said, I really enjoy selling. I like meeting with customers, building relationships, and I feel that most of my sales appointments go well.  Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated‚Äîespecially if you're in construction or another high-ticket sales field."}

Sometimes too straight that people had to remind me to introduce myself and the company in a bit more than 2-3 words.  But it got me a very high conversion rate as buyers got interested and things moved fast. And then the relationship building in parallel helped.  But those focused pitches actually took more time to prepare and reduced the number of opportunities i could go after. When I compared outcomes with others - the numbers were much better.  Here is what I follow. Happy to see what works for others. Some say a combination of both approaches is better but I am yet to see such cases. In fact, generic pitches scare away buyers from approaching you in future too.  1.It's about them (the buyer) and not you:  - No one is looking for your features.  - People are looking for solutions to their problems, their needs, their wants.  - Have your ears ON and mouth mostly OFF.  2. Getting prospect/ customer context beforehand and prepping well for the first meeting (if you don't have direct info, use public domain)  - Know their business, Financials, Pain points, Roadmap, Recent news. Yes, you might not know it all especially on first contact but be ready with knowledge of potential pain points and roadmap.  - Know the key stakeholders you are meeting including possible objections  Most customers are not expecting that kind of prep in the first meeting. So, it's a big positive.  3. Problem-solution map:  - Play back the problems and verify your understanding  - Provide mapping of those problems to your solutions (needs a lot of real prep)  - Provide differentiators and examples/ proofs  Yes, that's lot of work but worth it -- much better than generic stuff in my view. Happy to know the views of the community"}

So I‚Äôm thinking a little bit of experience even if I got fired from it looks better than a guy from a good college 2 years out of school with NO experience.  Also, about the laptop. Yeah they gave me some shitty lap top and I never returned it. They haven‚Äôt contacted me about it it‚Äôs been a year."}

Am currently the Director of Global Sales Development. It‚Äôs a role I‚Äôve held at two very successful unicorn companies for the last 8 years. And I really want to transition out of leadership and into Sales.  12 years ago, getting in as an SDR turned my life around. No college degree, single parent, looking for something Mon-Fri w/ health insurance. I climbed my way up from SDR ‚Äî> Sr. SDR ‚Äî> Team Lead ‚Äî> ‚Äî> Manager ‚Äî> Sr. Manager ‚Äî> and now Director.  I‚Äôve led global teams >60 people with multiple leadership levels under me, generating hundreds of millions in pipeline to support revenue targets. Fought for and closed millions in budget to support my department and supporting orgs. I‚Äôve started at two Series A companies leading and building the SDR function, that later turned into Series D/E unicorns. I know I‚Äôm good, but don‚Äôt want to do Sales Development anymore.  The next natural step would be VP of Global Sales Development. But honestly, I don‚Äôt want it. I‚Äôm of the mind that soon, big expense roles like mine will start to phase out of tech org structure. Sales Dev never seems to get the same respect and priority as GTM roles that actually touch revenue.  I want to take a step back, get into Enterprise Sales, and start the climb over again. The end goal being a VP of Sales or CRO/COO role in the 12 years ahead.  Here are my concerns:  ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†My OTE is $300k/year. I‚Äôve earned 10-12% over this in the last two years. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†I‚Äôm willing to take a pay cut to make this move, but not a large one. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†I have only closed a handful of deals in my entire career, out of necessity. One with an enterprise telco company, the rest with commercial accounts. Closing is not a skill I can confidently tout. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†I‚Äôve managed commercial and inside sales teams a few times. All for under a year and in an interim way (Sales leader departs, business doesn‚Äôt know where to put the reps, gives them to me while they backfill). This is a different motion than enterprise sales. ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†So, I lack the 5-10 years closing experience in enterprise accounts that most companies require.  I have a healthy network, and plan to start putting out feelers about EAE roles, but am looking for perspective on the hurdles I might encounter, how others have overcome them, and any other advice to get into a Sales Leadership career path from where I am.  How do I make the switch without entirely cannibalizing my current high income? Should I stay put and wait until AI renders SDRs redundant?"}

I‚Äôm setting up our sales pipelines and wondering how best to name them. Our company divides territories by region (e.g., South Central Region, North Central, Western, Eastern, etc.), and each of these regions is managed by a Regional Sales Manager. Under each manager, we also have local reps who are the boots on the ground handling accounts.  My question is: Should I name each pipeline after the territory (e.g., ‚ÄúWestern Region Pipeline‚Äù) or after the Regional Manager responsible (e.g., ‚ÄúJim Williams Pipeline‚Äù)?  I want to keep things organized and scalable, especially since the local reps roll up to their regional manager. Curious how others handle this in HubSpot or similar CRMs."}
